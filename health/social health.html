        <h1>Social Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Humans are social creatures. We’re meant to have relationships and connections for our health and wellness. </p>

        <p> You could be eating a healthy well-balanced diet, getting enough sleep and exercising but still missing a vital part of your overall health. With an ageing population and the increased profile of mental health, the community is more aware of social health. Research has proven that good social wellness has both physical and mental benefits. </p>

        <p> Social health can be defined as our ability to interact and form meaningful relationships with others. It also relates to how comfortably we can adapt in social situations. Social relationships have an impact on our mental health, physical health and mortality risk. </p>

        <p> Over the years, sociologists have created a link between social relationships and health outcomes. Studies are showing that social relationships both quality and quantity are having short and long-term effects on our health. </p>

       <h3> Dimensions of social health</h3>

        <p> There are 5 dimensions of social health and well- being i.e social integration, social contribution, social coherence, social actualization and social acceptance.</p>

        <ol>
        <li><strong> Social integration</strong></li>
        <p> It is the feeling as a part of society. It explains the extent to which feelings of an individual are related to the society and community. It reflects the commonness of an individual with the others along with the sense of belonging. For being socially integrated, the interdependence on others through norms and fondness is must. Lack of social integration leads to estrangement from society and individual feels socially rejected.</p>

        <li><strong> Social contribution</strong></li>
        <p> It is feeling of an individual’s value in society. It reflects self-obligation of a person towards others and whether the behavior of a person affects the society as a whole. To contribute socially, an individual must feel responsible to give something valuable to the world. If not able to do so then an individual may feel alienated from the society. As per Erikson, midlife is the period adults can contribute most to the society and shape the coming generation into productive members of society.</p>

        <li><strong> Social coherence</strong></li>
        <p> It is a state where an individual or a group interact with each other. Interaction among people give rise to new ideas and ability to maintain coherence when faced with undesired and stressful life events.</p>

        <li><strong> Social actualization</strong></li>
        <p> It is positive comfort level with others. There is openness to ideas, efforts and experiences to grow continually. People who can envision this potential in themselves are socially healthy. They realize that they have the ability to make society better and healthier and in turn, they will be the beneficiaries of the social growth.    </p>   

        <li><strong> Social acceptance</strong></li>
        <p> It is the ability of a person to accept the good and tolerate the bad in society. In order to fit in the community, an individual might behave like others around him/her. People exhibit this behavior to feel comfortable in society. An individual with good understanding of self and who accepts both good and bad in self is known to have a good social and mental health. Thus, it can be said that the self-acceptance is necessary for social acceptance of others.</p>

        <h1>Importance of Social Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Our social health and social wellness are a vital part of our overall health and wellbeing. </p>
        <p> Because social support enhances quality of life and provides a buffer against adverse life events.</p>

        <p> When you give and receive social support on a daily basis, you ensure that you’ll have friends and family to turn to in times of need or crisis to give you a broader focus and positive self-image.</p>

        <p>We interact with people every day. The quality and quantity of our relationships affect our mental and physical wellbeing. Maintaining a good level of social wellness lets you build interpersonal relationships with others. These relationships include friendships, intimate relationships, platonic, family, and professional (work) relationships.</p>

        <p> Healthy relationships are a vital component of health. </p>
    <p>Research shows that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> People who have a strong social network tend to live longer.</li>
        <li> The heart and blood pressure of people with healthy relationships respond better to stress.</li>
        <li> Strong social networks are associated with a healthier endocrine system and healthier cardiovascular functioning.</li>
        <li> Healthy social networks enhance the immune system’s ability to fight off infectious diseases.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Signs of Being Socially Healthy Include: </p>

        <li> Having assertive skills rather than passive or aggressive ones</li>
        <li> Balancing your social and personal time</li>
        <li> Being engaged with other people in the community</li>
        <li> Adapting in social situations </li>
        <li> To be yourself in all situations</li>
        <li> Treating others with respect</li>
        <li> Being able to develop and maintain friendships and networks</li>
        <li> Creating boundaries in friendships to encourage communication and conflict management</li>
        <li> Having a supportive network of family and friends</li>
        <li> Having fun in life</li>

        <h1>Path to Improve Social Health</h1>
        <hr>

        <p> Good social skills are a learned behaviour that takes practice. But it’s not too late for anyone to improve their social wellness. Every stage of life has opportunities for enjoying a socially healthy life.</p> 

        <ul>

        <li><strong> Start with Self Care:</strong>
        Before you can set out to improve your social wellness, you need to practice self-care. Look after yourself by getting enough sleep, eating a healthy balanced diet, exercising and removing any coping mechanisms like excessive alcohol consumption. Understand what causes you stress and how to not let it consume you.  </li> 

        <li><strong> Making Friends (and Maintaining Friendships):</strong>
        Even the most social, confident people can feel intimidated about making new friends. </li>

        <li><strong> Small Talk:</strong>
        Make conversation using easy topics about what they like to do in their spare time, TV series they enjoy watching or the weather. Listen to their responses and if you have something in common, keep the conversation going by talking more about that interest.</li>  

        <li><strong> Reaching Out:</strong>
        We lose friendships when we don’t keep in regular contact. Set yourself a goal of contacting one or two friends each week. Pick up the phone, befriend them on social media or email them, to show them you care and value your relationship. Plan to do something fun together or just a catch-up for a coffee. It doesn’t have to be anything expensive, as long as you’re catching up face to face regularly is what matters most. </li>

        <li><strong> Find a Community Group:</strong>
        Not everyone needs close friendships. Some people prefer plenty of low-key friendships and acquaintances throughout different areas of their lives. </li>


        <li><strong> Use Exercise to Meet Others:</strong>
        Joining a gym or even taking your pet to the park at a similar time each day, will mean you often see the same people. Even if it’s just someone who says hello and asks how your day is, start up a conversation with them. These types of relationships can make all the difference to improve your social wellness. </li>
    </ul>

        <h3> Nurture Your Relationships</h3>
        
        <p> Relationships fade out if neither party works at them. It only takes one person in a friendship to keep it going. Don’t worry if you’re always making the effort. You’re benefitting from a healthy relationship and your friend appreciates you even more for valuing them which makes you feel good. A couple’s relationship can take effort from both sides, but you can be the one to set the tone and good example.</p>   

        <ul>
        <li><strong> Make a Commitment and Keep It</strong></li>
        <p> If you have organised to be somewhere or do something, try to keep the date. It’s normal to sometimes not feel like going out. Sitting on the lounge at home may be the easy option, but your friend won’t feel valued if you keep cancelling. There’s a good chance you won’t feel good about yourself either for making an excuse for not going. Unless you’re unwell, don’t cancel a commitment.</p> 

        <li><strong> Don’t Blame or Criticise</strong></li>
        <p> It’s easy to have a go at someone, but we’re all different. Accept that everyone has a right to live their life differently to yours. Chances are you aren’t always in the right so don’t act like you are. Instead talk out a problem without anger, recrimination, or blame.</p>   

        <li><strong> Master Verbal and Non-Verbal Appreciation</strong></li>
        <p> Everyone wants to feel valued. Try to show you appreciate your friend or contact through various verbal and non-verbal cues. The more valued a friend feels, the more enjoyable their experience is in the relationship and the longer they will want to keep it going.</p>  

        <li><strong> Attentiveness and Listening</strong>
        <p> Everyone wants to feel they’re being listened to. Couple or friendship fatigue can set in and you tune out when the other person is talking. Be mindful of it and use active listening, giving feedback when appropriate but don’t interrupt the other person while they’re getting out their thoughts.</p> </li> 
    </ul>

       <h3> Work On Your Communication Skills</h3>
       <p> A large part of making and keeping friends is communication. Some people feel their poor communication skills make it difficult to socialise and build a rapport with new people. For some, it’s a condition they were born with while for others it’s a lack of confidence or practice. There are courses that people can take online or in person that help can help with communication skills. </p> 

        <p> Tips for Good Communication Skills:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Maintain good eye contact when someone is talking to you</li>
        <li> Be a good listener and give the other person plenty of time to talk </li>
        <li> Don’t feel you need to talk straight away, think about your response </li>
        <li> Watch your body language - unfold your arms, nod your head, vary facial expressions to look interested  </li> 
    </ul>
