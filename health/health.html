        <hr>

        <p>The word health refers to a state of complete emotional and physical well-being. Healthcare exists to help people maintain this optimal state of health.</p>

        <p>Good health is central to handling stress and living a longer, more active life. In this article, we explain the meaning of good health, the types of health a person needs to consider, and how to preserve good health.</p>

        <p>“Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”</p>

        <p>This means that health is a resource to support an individual’s function in wider society, rather than an end in itself. A healthful lifestyle provides the means to lead a full life with meaning and purpose.</p>

        <h1 class="headings" > Types of Health. </h1>
        <hr>

        <p>Mental and physical health are probably the two most frequently discussed types of health.</p>

        <p>Spiritual, emotional, and financial health also contribute to overall health. Medical experts have linked these to lower stress levels and improved mental and physical well-being.</p>    
            
           <p> People with better financial health, for example, may worry less about finances and have the means to buy fresh food more regularly. Those with good spiritual health may feel a sense of calm and purpose that fuels good mental health.</p>

        <h1 class="headings" >Factors for good health </h1>
        <hr>

        <p>Good health depends on a wide range of factors.</p>

        <h2> Genetic factors</h2>
       <p> A person is born with a variety of genes. In some people, an unusual genetic pattern or change can lead to a less-than-optimum level of health. People may inherit genes from their parents that increase their risk for certain health conditions.</p>

        <h2> Environmental factors</h2>
       <p> Environmental factors play a role in health. Sometimes, the environment alone is enough to impact health. Other times, an environmental trigger can cause illness in a person who has an increased genetic risk of a particular disease.</p>

       <p> Access to healthcare plays a role, but the WHO suggest that the following factors may have a more significant impact on health than this:</p>
            <ul>
        <li> Where a person lives</li>
        <li> The state of the surrounding environment</li>
        <li> Genetics</li>
        <li> Their income</li>
        <li> Their level of education</li>
        <li> Employment status</li>

            </ul>

           <p> It is possible to categorize these as follows:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong> The social and economic environment</strong></li>
        <p> This may include the financial status of a family or community, as well as the social culture and quality of relationships.</p>

        <li><strong> The physical environment</strong></li>
        <p> This includes which germs exist in an area, as well as pollution levels.</p>

        <li><strong> A person’s characteristics and behaviors</strong></li>
        <p> A person’s genetic makeup and lifestyle choices can affect their overall health.</p>
        </ul>

          <p>It may not be possible to avoid disease altogether. However, a person should do as much as they can to develop resilience and prepare the body and mind to deal with illnesses as they arise.</p>
