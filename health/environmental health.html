        <h1>Environmental Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Many people often think of environmental health in terms of clean air and water, but natural environmental forces—including things like global warming—are only one piece of a greater puzzle.</p>

        <p> Environmental health is the public health field that monitors and addresses those physical, chemical, and biological factors that we might not have direct control over, but can impact our health anyway. For example, if you live in a neighborhood with unsafe sidewalks or polluted air, it’s difficult to get outside and exercise. Similarly, what your home was built with, what insects live nearby, and what food you have access to all can affect your health and the health of your family.</p>

        <p> Simply put, environmental health is the area of public health that deals with all the different ways the world around us can impact our physical and mental well-being.</p>

        <p> Environmental health (EH) is a branch of public health protection that is concerned with all aspects of the natural and built environment that may affect human health. Other terms that refer to the discipline of environmental health include environmental public health and environmental health and protection.</p>

        <p> EH is a field of science that studies how the environment influences human health and disease. "Environment" in this context means identifying and addressing how the environment impacts human health.</p>

        <p> EH is a very diverse field where professionals perform a variety of tasks such as research, investigations, outreach and education, environmental cleanups and more.</p>

        <p> EH professionals are best known for their efforts to ensure the safety of what we eat, breathe, touch and drink. EH professionals are the individuals who monitor air quality, water and noise pollution, toxic substances and pesticides, conduct restaurant inspections, carry out vector control and promote healthy land use and housing. EH professionals also perform research on a variety of topics including environmental toxins, communicable disease outbreaks, human health impacts of environmental catastrophes such as hurricanes and more The increase in environmental health threats such as bed bug infestations, tainted food outbreaks such as Escherichia coli, failing waste water systems, West Nile virus, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), bio/agro-terrorism (intentional tainting of food) and the human health impacts of terrorist attacks and environmental catastrophes, demonstrate the need for more trained professionals in the field of environmental health.</p>

        <h1>Importance of Enviromental Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> We need safe, healthy and supportive environments for good health. The environment in which we live is a major determinant of our health and wellbeing.  We depend on the environment for energy and the materials needed to sustain life, such as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Clean air</li>
        <li> Safe drinking water</li>
        <li> Nutritious food</li>
        <li> Safe places to live.</li>
    </ul>

        <p> Many aspects of our environment – both built and natural environment – can impact on our health. It’s important that we interpret health issues in the wider context of our environment and where we live.</p>

        <p>Maintaining a healthy environment is essential for helping people live longer and for enhancing their quality of life. Consider a sobering statistic from Healthy People, which notes that 23% of all deaths (and 26% of deaths among children ages 5 and younger) result from entirely preventable environmental health problems.</p>

        <p>By optimizing environmental health, communities can reduce exposure to disease, as well as to pollutants that have a toxic effect on the body. The benefits of environmental health interventions can improve life for everyone, but may have the most pronounced effect among those who are already in vulnerable health. As Healthy People points out, “Poor environmental quality has its greatest impact on people whose health status is already at risk.”</p>

        <h1>Environmental Factors that Affect Health</h1>
        <hr>

        <p> From the quality of the air you breathe to the condition of the roads you drive on, environmental factors can have a major influence on your health. What’s more, these factors have evolved considerably over time, due to both natural and human-caused events.</p>

        <p> Professionals in the environmental health field examine how people interact with the world around them, chronicling the many ways that these interactions can impact physical fitness, vulnerability to disease, and other aspects of human wellness.</p>

        <p> We will explore eight key environmental factors that affect health:</p>

    </ol>

    <h3 id="Chemical Safety"> Chemical Safety</h3>
        <p> Different chemicals can impact human health in different ways, and often, exposure to dangerous or foreign substances creates health vulnerabilities. The chemical safety field is concerned with minimizing the effects of both natural and synthetic chemicals. More specifically, chemical safety seeks to safeguard human and environmental health from exposure to potential toxins; it focuses on chemicals that exist in the ambient world, as well as synthetic chemicals that are used in industrial processes or are the by-products of manufacturing activity.</p>

        <p> Public health officials who work in chemical safety often focus on toxicology, which is the study of substances that have a toxic effect on the human body, whether when ingested or when absorbed through natural surroundings. Another important aspect of public health is chemical risk assessment, which involves scientists and clinicians working to determine a substance’s full biological effects.</p>

        <h3 id="Air Pollution"> Air Pollution</h3>
       <p> Studies have shown that air pollution effects on humans are a significant public health concern, not only because of their role in climate change, but also because exposure to air pollution can increase morbidity and mortality.

       <p> When environmental scientists talk about air pollution, they’re describing any solid or liquid particles, as well as gases, that are suspended in the air and have harmful or poisonous effects. When we think about air pollution, we tend to think in terms of human-caused pollutants, and rightly so: Some of the most dangerous and ubiquitous examples of air pollution include car and truck exhaust, as well as polluting by-products of industrial processes. However, many natural air pollutants can cause health concerns; for example, pollen and mold spores are often linked with asthma and allergies.

        <h3 id="Climate Change and Natural Disasters">Climate Change and Natural Disasters</h3>
        
        <p> Another environmental issue with serious ramifications for human health is climate change, along with the increase in natural disasters that has accompanied the shift in Earth’s climate. The National Environmental Health Association lists climate change as the single biggest human health threat of the 21st century.</p>

        <p> Climate change disrupts the natural world in a number of ways that can impede health and increase vulnerability to disease; these include increases in the planet’s temperature and more frequent heavy rains and runoff. The various impacts may result in greater vulnerability to nervous and respiratory diseases, diarrhea, and more.</p>

        <p> Additionally, climate change increases the frequency of natural disasters, often having a ravenous effect on homes and communities and sometimes resulting in loss of life. Wildfires, hurricanes, cyclones, and droughts are just a few examples.</p>

        <h3 id="Diseases Caused by Microbes"> Diseases Caused by Microbes</h3>
        <p> Diseases caused by microbes — also known as microorganisms — present another area of public health concern. Trillions of microbes exist within the human body, and they also live in water, soil, and air. Most of them have no negative health effects, and many microbes perform important biological functions, such as supporting digestive and immune health, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi are types of microbes.</p>

        <p> Harmful microbes, which are more commonly called pathogens or germs, can infect humans and cause illness. Eating is one of the primary ways in which humans can contract diseases caused by microbes. One example is food poisoning from E. coli, a type of bacteria that can be found in the environment and in foods, and which can cause respiratory illness, urinary tract infections, and other adverse health effects.</p>

        <p> There are also a number of harmful microbes that live in the soil. Humans can come into contact with them by ingesting them (through contaminated food) or through inhaling them (through soil particles in the air). Tetanus and botulism are examples of diseases caused by soil-borne microbes.</p>

        <h3 id="Lack of Access to Health Care"> Lack of Access to Health Care</h3>
        <p> Another environmental factor that contributes to disease and overall poor health outcomes is living in an area with a lack of access to health care services.</p>

        <p> According to Healthy People, “Many people face barriers that prevent or limit access to needed health care services, which may increase the risk of poor health outcomes and health disparities.” Some factors that contribute to lack of access to health care are economic instability, unreliable transportation to clinical facilities, and simple lack of education about the importance of preventive care.</p>

        <p> Individuals who don’t have access to health care services (including pharmaceuticals as well as dental care) are at a higher risk for chronic conditions, which may include asthma, cancer, diabetes, or heart disease.</p>

       <h3 id="Infrastructure Issues"> Infrastructure Issues</h3>
        <p> Infrastructure issues can also have a major impact on community health.</p> 
        <p> Examples include the following:</p>

        <ul>
        <li> Poorly maintained roads (increasing risk of car accidents)</li>
        <li> Lack of access to clean drinking water</li>
        <li> Lack of local health care infrastructure, such as clinics capable of giving vaccinations</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Overcoming poor infrastructure requires the right allocation of resources from local, state, and federal governments, as well as a qualified workforce to keep infrastructure properly maintained.</p>

       <h3 id="Poor Water Quality"> Poor Water Quality</h3>
       <p> Verywell Health reports that across the world, more than 780 million people don’t have access to clean drinking water; shockingly, about a third of the world’s population lacks access to proper sanitation services (e.g., clean bathrooms). The health implications are sobering: Each day, more than 2,200 children die due to diseases caused by poor water quality.</p>

       <p> A number of factors can contribute to poor water quality, including industrial waste and pollution, lack of access to proper water treatment and sanitation services, and outdated plumbing infrastructure.</p>

       <h3 id="Global Environmental Issues"> Global Environmental Issues</h3>
       <p> Global environmental issues account for more than 12.6 million deaths each year, according to WHO data. Along with the issues mentioned here, these can include soil pollution, ultraviolet radiation, and biodiversity loss. According to the data, more than 100 illnesses and injuries can be directly linked to environmental health concerns. Often, these issues have the greatest impact on communities that are poor and already have significant health care vulnerabilities.</p>
