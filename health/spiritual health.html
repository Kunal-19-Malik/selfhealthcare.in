        <h1>Spiritual Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Spirituality is the broad concept of a belief in something beyond the self. It may involve religious traditions centering on the belief in a higher power, but it can also involve a holistic belief in an individual connection to others and to the world as a whole. </p>

        <p> The spiritual element of wellness can be the most personal piece of the puzzle when trying to place all eight dimensions of wellness together. Generally, people like to live a life with meaning and purpose. When these goals are met, it puts harmony in one’s life, and the others they surround themselves with. </p>

        <p> Spirit and spirituality can mean different things to different people across many cultures. A person’s spirit or spirituality is hard to define, but broadly it is the non-physical part of a person, it is the source of our emotions, our character and even our soul.</p>

        <p> In our spiritual selves is where we find our sense of belonging, our connections with certain people or groups of people and with places.  </p>

        <p> Many of us have explored Spirituality in our own ways. Although this quest is very individual (i.e., we all have our own personal definition of Spirituality), it is collective in spirit. This is because Spirituality in people’s minds is synonymous with a search for meaning, for purpose and direction in life.</p>

        <p> People get attracted to Spirituality and embark on their spiritual journeys for different reasons. Generically, there are a few main reasons for this.</p>

        <ol>
        <li><strong> Curiosity about the spiritual dimension :</strong> This includes seeking answers to the more profound questions in life such as – what is the purpose of life, where did I come from and where do we go after death ?</li>

        <li><strong> When facing a problem in life :</strong> Insurmountable problems in life are often a catalyst for people to search for an answer to their problems beyond the purview of modern science. This includes approaching an astrologer, a psychic or a holy man.</li>

        <li><strong> Interested in spiritual healing :</strong> The ability to heal by channelising subtle energies is an art that has been pursued for millennia.</li>

        <li><strong> Interested in personality improvement :</strong> Wanting to be a better person can lead one to Spirituality and a more spiritual way of life.</li>

        <li><strong> Wanting to grow spiritually :</strong> Some of us have an innate need to grow spiritually and do not need a catalyst to push us towards Spirituality.</li>
    </ol>

        <p> For those who seek the meaning of Spirituality there is much literature that can be found on the web. However, this presents another problem as one may get confused as to what to choose as an accurate definition. In this article, we provide the definition of Spirituality and provide practical insights about Spirituality.</p>

       <h3> What is Spirit ?</h3>
        <p> Māori have always recognised the significance of wairua (spirituality) for wellbeing and good health in general, and this really applies to all people.</p>

        <p> Spirit describes the capacity to have faith, and to recognise the links between you and others and the world around you. It doesn’t necessarily mean having a religious belief, although this might be an important part of your spirituality.</p>

        <p> Spirit is also reflected in places we feel a connection to - the place you grew up, the beaches you surfed, lakes, mountains and rivers or the lands your ancestors fought for - all will have spiritual significance.</p>

        <p> You will also have spiritual connections to certain social groups such as whānau, friends, your unit, hapu or iwi. These are powerful bonds that can help you maintain your ‘belonging’ with these groups even when things are not going well or you are far away.</p>

        <h1>Importance of Spiritual Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> There are a number of different reasons why people may turn to spirituality, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong> To find purpose and meaning :</strong> Exploring spirituality can help people find answers to questions they have about philosophical questions such as "what is the meaning of life?" and "what purpose does my life serve?"</li>

        <li><strong> To cope with feelings of stress, depression, and anxiety :</strong> Spiritual experiences can be helpful when coping with the stresses of life. </li>

        <li><strong> To restore hope and optimism :</strong> Spirituality can help people develop a more hopeful outlook on life.</li>

       <li><strong>  To find a sense of community and support :</strong> Because spiritual traditions often involve organized religions or groups, becoming a part of such a group can serve as an important source of social support.</li>
    </ul>
      <p> People who feel comfortable and comforted using spirituality as a coping mechanism for stress can rest assured that there's even more evidence that this is a good idea for them. Prayer works for young and old alike. Prayer and spirituality have been linked to:

        <h1>Path to Improve Spiritual Health</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>If you want to improve your spiritual health, you may want to try the following ideas. However, remember that everyone is different. What works for others may not work for you. Do what is comfortable for you.</p>

        <p>Spirituality is a very personal experience, and everyone’s spiritual path may be unique. Research shows, however, that some spiritual stress relief strategies have been helpful to many, regardless of faith. </p>
           <p> Some things you can do to start exploring spirituality include:</p>
        <ul>
           <li><strong>  Pay attention to how you are feeling :</strong> Part of embracing spirituality means also embracing what it means to be human, both the good and the bad. </li>

           <li><strong>  Focus on others :</strong> Opening your heart, feeling empathy, and helping others are important aspects of spirituality.</li>

           <li><strong>  Meditate :</strong> Try spending 10 to 15 minutes each morning engaged in some form of meditation.</li>

           <li> <strong> Practice gratitude :</strong> Start a gratitude journal and record what you are grateful for each day. This can be a great reminder of what is most important to you and what brings you the greatest happiness.</li>

           <li><strong>  Try mindfulness :</strong> By becoming more mindful, you can become more aware and appreciative of the present. Mindfulness encourages you to be less judgmental (both of yourself and others) and focus more on the present moment rather than dwelling on the past or future.</li>

         <li><strong>  Explore your spiritual core :</strong> By exploring your spiritual core, you are simply asking yourself questions about the person you are and your meaning. Ask yourself: Who am I? What is my purpose? What do I value most? These questions will lead you down a road where you will think more in-depth about yourself and allow you to notice things about yourself that will help you achieve fulfillment.  </li>

        <li><strong> Look for deeper meanings :</strong> Looking for deeper meanings in your life and analyzing occurring patterns will help you see that you have control over your destiny. Being aware of this can help you achieve a happy and healthy life.</li>

        <li><strong> Get it out :</strong> Expressing what is on your mind will help you to maintain a focused mind. After a long day or a significant event, you may feel confused and not be able to make sense of your feelings. By writing down your thoughts, you may be able to think clearer and move forward.</li>

        <li><strong> Try yoga :</strong> Yoga is a physical technique that can help improve your spiritual wellness by reducing emotional and physical strains on your mind and body. Yoga is taught at all different levels and can help lower stress, boost the immune system, and lower blood pressure as well as reduce anxiety, depression, fatigue, and insomnia. </li>

        <li><strong> Travel :</strong> It’s true! Taking time for yourself to travel to a comforting place or somewhere new can do wonders for your mind. When you are at a place where your mind can keep out distractions and help you reflect and rest, you will have a better connection with yourself. This allows you to weed out stressors and set your mind on the right path for overall wellness. Some activities to take part in when on a trip can be exercising, speaking with a counselor or advisor, meditation, or taking a temporary vow of silence.</li>

        <li><strong> Think positively :</strong> Once you start viewing things in your life in a positive manner, you will find yourself thinking differently and refocusing your mind to a happy, healthy place. When you eliminate negativity and re-frame how you think of certain things and situations, you’ll notice yourself being more relaxed.</li>
        </ul>
       <p> There are many generic paths to God and the most popular ones are listed below :</p>
        <ol>
       <li><em> Bhaktiyoga</em> – The Path of Devotion</li>
       <li><em> Namsankirtanyoga</em> – The Path of Chanting</li>
       <li><em> Karmakand</em> – The Path of Ritualistic Worship</li>
       <li><em> Karmayoga</em> – The Path of Action (i.e. to have no expectation of fruit from an action which is performed)</li>
       <li><em> Dhyanyoga</em> – The Path of Meditation</li>
       <li><em> Dnyanyoga</em> – The Path of Knowledge (Receiving knowledge pertaining to the Soul through Holy texts or in the subtle)</li>
       <li><em> Hathayoga</em> – The Path of Deliberate Rigor</li>
       <li><em> Kundaliniyoga</em> – The Path of Spiritual Energy</li>
        </ol>
      <p> These paths have been designed so as to suit the temperament of the seeker. However, regardless of which Path to God one chooses, it is important that one reduces the intensity of one’s personality defects. If one has many personality defects, one cannot sustain on any path.</p>

        <h1>Symptoms in lack of Spiritual Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Spirituality can be a great source of comfort. But when a person is facing a loss, physical and emotional pain, or other challenges, they may experience spiritual distress. Spiritual distress occurs when a person is no longer able to find meaning, peace, comfort, strength, or connection in life.</p>

        <p> It's natural for individuals who have been diagnosed with a terminal illness or who are experiencing great physical or emotional pain to question their beliefs. Understanding how to recognize spiritual distress can help you better assist an individual who is experiencing these signs and symptoms.</p>

        <p> Spiritual distress can be experienced differently by different people. The signs and symptoms of spiritual distress include:</p>

            <ul>
           <li> Feelings of anger or hopelessness</li>
           <li> Feelings of depression and anxiety</li>
           <li> Difficulty sleeping</li>
           <li> Feeling abandoned by God</li>
           <li> Questioning the meaning of life or suffering</li>
           <li> Questioning beliefs or sudden doubt in spiritual or religious beliefs</li>
           <li> Asking why this situation occurred</li>
           <li> Seeking spiritual help or guidance</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The best way to assist someone experiencing spiritual distress is to be an active listener and provide support in a calm, peaceful environment. Speak with the individual about their life. Talk through good times as well as bad to help them gain perspective.</p>

        <h1>Self Health Care Line</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Social health can be defined as our ability to interact and form meaningful relationships with others. It also relates to how comfortably we can adapt in social situations. Social relationships have an impact on our mental health, physical health and mortality risk. </p>
        <p> Good social skills are a learned behaviour that takes practice. But it’s not too late for anyone to improve their social wellness. Every stage of life has opportunities for enjoying a socially healthy life.</p> 


        <p>Our social health and social wellness are a vital part of our overall health and wellbeing. </p>
        <p> Because social support enhances quality of life and provides a buffer against adverse life events.</p>

        <p> You may have noticed that when you’re feeling down and out, that your physical and mental health suffers. During those periods, if you shied away from connecting with others, you also likely felt more of an impact on your overall health.</p>
