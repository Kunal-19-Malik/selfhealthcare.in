        <h1>Mental Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. It is all about how people think, feel, and behave. People sometimes use the term “mental health” to mean the absence of a mental disorder. </p>

        <p> Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and physical health.</p>

        <p> However, this link also works in the other direction. Factors in people’s lives, interpersonal connections, and physical factors can all contribute to mental health disruptions.</p>

        <p> Looking after mental health can preserve a person’s ability to enjoy life. Doing this involves reaching a balance between life activities, responsibilities, and efforts to achieve psychological resilience.</p>

        <p> Conditions such as stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect mental health and disrupt a person’s routine.</p>

        <p> Although the term mental health is in common use, many conditions that doctors recognize as psychological disorders have physical roots.</p>

        <p> Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>

        <p> Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:</p>

        <ul>
        <li> Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry</li>
        <li> Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse</li>
        <li> Family history of mental health problems</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Importance of Mental Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Emotional and mental health is important because it’s a vital part of your life and impacts your thoughts, behaviors and emotions. Being healthy emotionally can promote productivity and effectiveness in activities like work, school or caregiving. It plays an important part in the health of your relationships, and allows you to adapt to changes in your life and cope with adversity.</p>

        <p>Mental illnesses affect 19% of the adult population, 46% of teenagers and 13% of children each year. People struggling with their mental health may be in your family, live next door, teach your children, work in the next cubicle or sit in the same church pew.</p>

        <p>However, only half of those affected receive treatment, often because of the stigma attached to mental health. Untreated, mental illness can contribute to higher medical expenses, poorer performance at school and work, fewer employment opportunities and increased risk of suicide.</p>

        <p>A mental illness is a physical illness of the brain that causes disturbances in thinking, behavior, energy or emotion that make it difficult to cope with the ordinary demands of life. Research is starting to uncover the complicated causes of these diseases which can include genetics, brain chemistry, brain structure, experiencing trauma and/or having another medical condition, like heart disease.</p>

        <p> Our behavioral health care is driven by patient need. It may include help managing any of the following conditions or situations:</p>
        <ul>
         <li> Depression</li>
         <li> Anxiety</li>
         <li> Stress</li>
         <li> Memory Loss</li>
         <li> Alzheimer’s Disease</li>
         <li> Mood Disorders, including seasonal affective disorder</li>
         <li> Living or Service Needs</li>
         <li> and beyond</li>

        <h1>Symptoms in lack of Mental Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The signs and symptoms of mental illness may be brushed aside as the angst of the turbulent teenage years. But, these may be the earliest predictors of mental health disorders or issues that require treatment.
        </p>
        <p> Each type of mental illness causes its own symptoms. But many share some common characteristics.</p>

        <p> Experiencing one or more of the following feelings or behaviors can be an early warning sign of a problem:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Not eating enough or overeating</li>
        <li> Having insomnia or sleeping too much</li>
        <li> Distancing yourself from other people and favorite activities</li>
        <li> Feeling fatigue even with enough sleep</li>
        <li> Feeling numbness or lacking empathy</li>
        <li> Experiencing unexplainable body pains or achiness</li>
        <li> Feeling hopeless, helpless or lost</li>
        <li> Smoking, drinking, or using illicit drugs more than ever before</li>
        <li> Feeling confusion, forgetfulness, irritability, anger, anxiety, sadness, or fright</li>
        <li> Constantly fighting or arguing with friends and family</li>
        <li> Having extreme mood swings that cause relationship problems</li>
        <li> Having constant flashbacks or thoughts that you can’t get out of your head</li>
        <li> Hearing voices in your head that you can’t stop</li>
        <li> Having thoughts of hurting yourself or other people</li>
        <li> Being unable to carry out day-to-day activities and chores</li>
    </ul>

        <p> Stress and periods of emotional distress can lead to an episode of symptoms. That may make it difficult for you to maintain normal behavior and activities. This period is sometimes called a nervous or mental breakdown.</p>

        <h1> Common mental health disorders</h1>

    </ul>
        
        <h3 id="Anxiety disorders" > Anxiety disorders</h3>
        <p> According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders are the most common type of mental illness.</p>
        
        <p> People with these conditions have severe fear or anxiety, which relates to certain objects or situations. Most people with an anxiety disorder will try to avoid exposure to whatever triggers their anxiety.</p>
        
        <p> Examples of anxiety disorders include:</p>
        <p><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</strong></p>
        
        <p> The GAD define as disproportionate worry that disrupts everyday living.</p>
        
        <p> People might also experience physical symptoms, including:</p>
        <ul>
           <li> Restlessness</li>
           <li> Fatigue</li>
           <li> Tense muscles</li>
           <li> Interrupted sleep</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A bout of anxiety symptoms does not necessarily need a specific trigger in people with GAD.</p>
        
        <p> They may experience excessive anxiety on encountering everyday situations that do not present a direct danger, such as chores or keeping appointments. A person with GAD may sometimes feel anxiety with no trigger at all.</p>
        
        
       <p><strong> Panic disorders</strong></p>
        
        <p> People with a panic disorder experience regular panic attacks, which involve sudden, overwhelming terror or a sense of imminent disaster and death.</p>
        
        
        <p><strong>Phobias</strong></p>
        
        <p> There are different types of phobia:</p>
        
       <li><strong>  Simple phobias</strong></li>
        <p>These might involve a disproportionate fear of specific objects, scenarios, or animals. A fear of spiders is a common example. </p>

        <li><strong> Social phobia</strong></li>
         <p>Sometimes known as social anxiety, this is a fear of being subject to the judgment of others. People with social phobia often restrict their exposure to social environments. </p>

       <li><strong>  Agora phobia</strong></li> 
       <p>This term refers to a fear of situations in which getting away may be difficult, such as being in an elevator or moving train. Many people misunderstand this phobia as a fear of being outside.</p>

        <p> Phobias are deeply personal, and doctors do not know every type. There could be thousands of phobias, and what might seem unusual to one person may be a severe problem that dominates daily life for another.</p>
        
        <p><strong> Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</strong></p>
        
        <p> People with OCD have obsessions and compulsions. In other words, they experience constant, stressful thoughts and a powerful urge to perform repetitive acts, such as hand washing.</p>
                
        <p><strong> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</strong></p>
        
        <p> PTSD can occur after a person experiences or witnesses a deeply stressful or traumatic event.</p>
        
        <p> During this type of event, the person thinks that their life or other people’s lives are in danger. They may feel afraid or that they have no control over what is happening.</p>
        
        <p> These sensations of trauma and fear may then contribute to PTSD.</p>
        
    </ol>
        
        <h3 id="Mood disorders"> Mood disorders</h3>
        <p> People may also refer to mood disorders as affective disorders or depressive disorders.</p>
        
        <p> People with these conditions have significant changes in mood, generally involving either mania, which is a period of high energy and elation, or depression.</p> 
        
        <p> Examples of mood disorders include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong> Major depression </strong></li>
        <p> An individual with major depression experiences a constant low mood and loses interest in activities and events that they previously enjoyed. They can feel prolonged periods of sadness or extreme sadness.</p>

        <li><strong> Bipolar disorder </strong></li>
        <p> A person with bipolar disorder experiences unusual changes in their mood, energy levels, levels of activity, and ability to continue with daily life. Periods of high mood are known as manic phases, while depressive phases bring on low mood. Read more about the different types of bipolar here.</p>

        <li><strong> Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)</strong></li>
         <p> Reduced daylight triggers during the fall, winter, and early spring months trigger this type of major depression. It is most common in countries far from the equator. </p>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Schizophrenia disorders"> Schizophrenia disorders</h3>
        <p> Mental health authorities are still trying to determine whether schizophrenia is a single disorder or a group of related illnesses. It is a highly complex condition.</p>
        
        <p> Signs of schizophrenia typically develop between the ages of 16 and 30 years. The individual will have thoughts that appear fragmented, and they may also find it hard to process information.</p>
        
        <p> Schizophrenia has negative and positive symptoms. Positive symptoms include delusions, thought disorders, and hallucinations. Negative symptoms include withdrawal, lack of motivation, and a flat or inappropriate mood.</p>

        <hr>
        <p> Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. It is all about how people think, feel, and behave. People sometimes use the term “mental health” to mean the absence of a mental disorder. </p>

        <p> Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and physical health.</p>

        <p>Mental illnesses affect 19% of the adult population, 46% of teenagers and 13% of children each year. People struggling with their mental health may be in your family, live next door, teach your children, work in the next cubicle or sit in the same church pew.</p>

        <p>The signs and symptoms of mental illness may be brushed aside as the angst of the turbulent teenage years. But, these may be the earliest predictors of mental health disorders or issues that require treatment.
