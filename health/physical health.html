        <h1>Physical Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Physical health is critical for overall well-being and is the most visible of the various dimensions of health, which also include social, intellectual, emotional, spiritual and environmental health. Some of the most obvious and serious signs that we are unhealthy appear physically.</p>

        <p> A clear distinction is often made between 'mind' and 'body'. But when considering mental health and physical health, the two should not be thought of as separate.</p>

        <p> Poor physical health can lead to an increased risk of developing mental health problems. Similarly, poor mental health can negatively impact on physical health, leading to an increased risk of some conditions.</p>

        <p> Physical health is the well-being of the body and the proper functioning of the organism of individuals, which is a normal condition for individuals of both physical, and mental condition who are not suffering from any type of sickness.</p>

       <p> Traditionally, physical health might have been understood as your physical body being free of disease or disability but as our healthcare has improved and people have started living longer and living with many different conditions, this definition has really evolved to reflect that concept.</p>

       <p> So, now the Physical health definition might be more focused on being able to live comfortably to do the things that you want to do. The more accurate definition of physical health could be ‘The ability to perform daily tasks and live comfortably in one’s body’.</p>

       <p><em> Physical Health is correlated with Mental Health because good physical health leaves a better personal feeling in the long term.</em></p>

        <h1>Importance of Physical Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Physical activity refers to all the movement we carry out throughout the day, such as doing housework, bring in shopping, walking to work and doing exercise like playing a sport or going to the gym. Evidence continues to mount that being physically active can benefit both body and mind, as well as reducing the risk of many diseases. Here are nine proven benefits of regular physical activity.</p>

        <ol>

        <li><strong> Helps maintain a healthy body weight</strong></li>
        <p> Low physical activity can increase someone’s risk of becoming overweight or obese.</p>
        <p>While exercising alone does not necessarily lead to weight loss, in combination with a balanced calorie-controlled diet, it can support successful weight reduction. </p>
        <p>In addition, there is evidence that regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy body weight over time.</p>

        <li><strong>A healthier state of mind</strong></li>
        <p>There are many views as to how exercise helps people with depression:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> Exercise may block negative thoughts or distract you from daily worries. </li>
            <li> Exercising with others provides an opportunity for increased social contact. </li>
            <li> Increased fitness may lift your mood and improve your sleep patterns. </li>
            <li> Exercise may also change levels of chemicals in your brain, such as serotonin, endorphins and stress hormones.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong> Lowers blood pressure</strong></li>
        <p> High blood pressure (or hypertension) is a risk factor for many diseases, particularly stroke and heart disease. </p>
        <p>Regular physical activity can increase your hearts strength, which reduces the effort needed to pump blood around the body. </p> 
        <p>This decreases the force on your arteries, reducing blood pressure. There is good evidence that regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy blood pressure.</p>


        <li><strong> Decreases the risk of heart disease</strong></li>
        <p> Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, running and cycling, has been shown to reduce the risk of developing heart disease.</p> 
       <p> This benefit is observed for people of all body sizes. People with overweight or obesity who are physically active are far less likely to get heart disease compared to those who aren’t.</p>


        <li><strong> Lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes</strong></li>
        <p> Exercise is known to help in the regulation of blood sugar levels and improves our bodies sensitivity to insulin.</p> 
            <p> Physical inactivity, on the other hand, has been consistently shown to increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p> 
            <p> Furthermore, regular exercise is often recommended to people with diabetes to aid in their control of blood sugar levels.</p>


        <li><strong> Reduces the risk of certain cancers</strong></li>
        <p> Cancer is a complex disease influenced by many controllable (e.g. smoking, unhealthy diet, high alcohol consumption) and uncontrollable (e.g. genetics, radiation, environmental pollutants) factors. </p>
           <p> Evidence suggests that regular moderate to vigorous exercise can help reduce our risk of developing certain types of cancers, including colon, colorectal, lung and breast cancers.</p>


        <li><strong> Increases muscle strength and function</strong></li>
        <p> Skeletal muscle serves many functions, it helps maintain posture, controls movement and generates body heat. As we age, our muscle mass tends to decrease, often due to a more sedentary lifestyle. </p>
           <p> This loss of muscle mass can reduce our mobility and increase our risk of falls and muscular diseases such as sarcopenia. Regular exercise, particularly resistance training (such as lifting weights or bodyweight exercises such as squats and push-ups) can help improve muscle strength and resilience and reduce our risk of muscular disorders like sarcopenia.</p>


        <li><strong> Improves bone health and strength</strong></li>
        <p> Weight-bearing exercise (e.g. running,  dancing), as well as resistance training, have been shown to improve bone density in adolescents and help maintain bone density in adulthood, reducing the risk of osteoporosis. </p>
           <p> This is particularly important for older adults and menopausal women as it can help to slow the natural loss of bone density that occurs with age.</p>


        <li><strong> Helps to promote positive mental health</strong></li>
        <p> Regular exercise has been shown to have a positive effect on our mental health and psychological well-being. The exact mechanism for which exercise benefits our mental health is not fully understood. </p>
           <p> What is known is regular exercise can promote the release of endorphins as well as help relieve stress and promote a healthy sleep pattern, which can all work together to improve our mood. In addition, there is some evidence to suggest that exercise may even help in the treatment of depression and other mental disorders.</p>


        <li><strong> Reduces the risk of dementia</strong></li>
        <p> Regular exercise has been consistently shown to protect against cognitive decline. Although it is still not fully understood how exercise reduces cognitive decline, recent evidence suggests that the release of proteins known as neurotrophic factors likely play an important role. </p>
            <p> These beneficial factors help promote neuron growth and repair which help support normal cognitive functioning. This may partly explain why older adults who remain physically active throughout life have a much lower risk of developing cognitive disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. </p>

        <h1>Path to Improve Physical Health</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The health benefits of regular exercise and physical activity are hard to ignore. Everyone benefits from exercise, regardless of age, sex or physical ability.</p>

        <p>Individual health impacts the entire community. Sick days inhibit work productivity and educational opportunities, and contagious illnesses do so exponentially. Long-term, chronic, and terminal maladies impact family economics, child care, and emotional health. Do your part to stay healthy and encourage others in your community to do the same by putting these five tips into practice. Most of these are free now and will save medical costs in the long run.</p>

        <p> We've all had those well-intentioned moments when we resolve to make sweeping lifestyle changes: Quit smoking. Lose 20 pounds. Join a gym and start exercising every day.</p>

        <p> While we should always strive to accomplish these types of health goals, the road to better health doesn't always have to mean making huge leaps.</p>
        
        <p> There are also many smaller steps you can take that will help improve your overall health and quality of life — and because they're things you can easily incorporate into your routine, they'll be easy to maintain for the long haul. Even if you have only a few minutes to spare, you can use that time to improve your well-being.</p>
        
        <p> Try incorporating the following activities and strategies into your day. When these simple steps become habits, they can add up to a big positive effect on your overall health.</p>

        <ol>
       <li><strong> Enjoy de-stressing</strong></li>
       <p> Experts recommend regular exercise, meditation and breathing techniques to reduce stress. But even something as simple — and enjoyable — as listening to soothing music, reading a good book, soaking in a hot tub or playing with your pet can help you relax. </p>

       <p> That's advice you should take to heart because prolonged stress can cause or exacerbate a number of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, depression, ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, migraines and obesity.</p>

       <p> Don't have a lot of time? Don't let that stress you out. As with exercise, even brief periods of relaxation are beneficial.</p>

       <p> Spending even 10 minutes at a time doing something you enjoy can go a long way toward beating the stressors of everyday life. Just reading one chapter or taking your dog for a few laps around the block will help you feel calmer, more refreshed and more energized.</p>

      <p>  If you can't take a full break from whatever you're doing, try simply taking a few slow, deep breaths in that moment. When you slow down your breathing, it helps you relax. This relaxation response releases body chemicals that relieve stress and may improve immune function.</p>

       <p> Deep breathing can also lower your resting heart rate. People with lower resting heart rates are typically in better physical condition than those with higher rates.</p>

       <li><strong> Put away the salt</strong></li> 
      <p>  A saltshaker on the dining table makes it all too easy to consume excess salt, which can lead to high blood pressure. So put the shaker in a cabinet or pantry and bring it out only when you're cooking.</p>

      <p>  It's also a good idea to taste your food before you salt it. You may find it doesn't need more.</p>

      <p>  You can also try spicing up your food with lemon or lime juice, garlic, red pepper flakes, herbs or a salt-free seasoning blend. Stock your fridge and pantry with your favorite fresh and dried herbs so you'll always have them on hand to flavor your foods.</p>

       <li> Get to bed earlier </li>
       <p> Most of us don’t get the seven or more hours of sleep adults need.</p>

       <p> Over time, a shortage of shut-eye can raise your risk of a heart attack or stroke — regardless of your age, weight or exercise habits.</p>

       <p> If you're consistently sleep-deprived, going to bed even 15 minutes earlier every night could help. Also set a regular sleep and wake schedule, and stick to it — even on days off.</p>

       <li><strong> Have a glass of red wine</strong> </li>
        <p> Studies have shown that the powerful antioxidants found in red wine protect against heart disease, colon cancer, anxiety and depression. So unless there is a medical reason why you shouldn't imbibe, go ahead and enjoy that glass of merlot with your nightly meal — you can even toast to your good health.</p>

        <p> But drink in moderation. Just as a small amount of red wine has health benefits, too much alcohol — even red wine — can cause a variety of health problems, including liver and kidney disease and cancer.</p>

        <p> Women, in particular, need to be careful about alcohol consumption. They are at higher overall risk of liver problems than men, so they are more likely to experience liver problems from smaller amounts of alcohol.</p>

        <p> For a healthy man, two drinks a day is not likely to do harm; women, on the other hand, should limit themselves to one daily alcoholic beverage.</p>

       <li><strong> Check your posture and ergonomics </strong></li>
   <p> Next time you're at your desk or on the phone, take a moment to think about your posture. Then straighten up your back, tuck in your stomach and put your feet flat on the floor with your legs uncrossed. You'll feel more relaxed right away.</p>

   <p> The few seconds this takes can help you avoid back pain, one of the most common health problems in the United States and a leading cause of disability.</p>

   <p> And if you work at a computer, look at the ergonomics of your workstation — how you fit and move in your environment — to help prevent back and neck strain, carpal tunnel syndrome, eye strain and other occupational injuries.</p>

   <p> A few simple adjustments, such as repositioning your computer monitor, switching to a chair that provides more low back support and taking regular breaks throughout the day to do stretching exercises, can go a long way toward creating a healthier and more comfortable workspace.</p>

   <p> The next time you're going to a higher floor, bypass the elevator and climb the stairs instead. You'll get your blood pumping, exercise your lungs and work the muscles in your lower body.</p>

       <li><strong> Do a crossword puzzle</strong> </li>
       <p> Researchers at Rush have found that mentally challenging activities, such as reading, doing crossword puzzles or Sodoku and playing chess, may have a protective effect on your brain.</p>

       <p> According to research studies, regularly engaging your mind may help lower your risk for the dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease.</p>

       <p> Don't enjoy puzzles or games? Don't worry: There are other ways to maintain your brain health. Eat with your nondominant hand. Walk a new route home from work. And connect with others — staying socially engaged may also protect against dementia.</p>

       <li><strong> Weight in</strong> </li>
        <p> Maintaining a healthy weight can lower your risk for heart disease, stroke and some types of cancer. But for women, there’s another reason to keep pounds from piling on: It will decrease the risk for future pelvic floor disorders.</p>

        <p> Pelvic floor disorders are more common in women who have delivered babies vaginally. However, a recent study found that even women who have never had a vaginal birth are at increased risk for urinary stress incontinence if they're overweight or obese.</p>

       <li><strong>  Make a few dietary substitutions</strong> </li>
            <ul>
        <li> Swap white bread, rice, crackers and pasta for healthier whole grain versions.</li>
        <li> Use skinless chicken and turkey in your recipes instead of skin-on, and leaner cuts of other meats such as beef or pork.  </li> 
        <li> Replace one sugary drink (soda, juice, etc.) each day with a tall glass of water.</li>
        <li> If you get hungry between meals, snack on a handful of almonds or cashews, a piece of whole fruit, or carrot sticks dipped in hummus rather than reaching for candy bars or potato chips.</li>
    </ul>

        <p> In addition, try incorporating an extra serving of nonstarchy vegetables into your daily diet.</p>

        <p> Want a snack? Munch on a carrot instead of a cookie. Making dinner for your family? Serve broccoli or spinach as a side dish instead of mashed potatoes. Add green peas to your brown rice, or slices of red or yellow pepper to your sandwich.</p>

        <p> It's no secret that vegetables — especially dark, leafy greens — are good for you. But there's another benefit to packing more veggies into your daily diet: They're rich in fiber and contain lots of water, so they'll leave you full and satisfied without a lot of calories and fat.</p>


       <li><strong>  Take the stairs </strong></li> 
           <p> The next time you're going to a higher floor, bypass the elevator and climb the stairs instead. You'll get your blood pumping, exercise your lungs and work the muscles in your lower body.</p>

           <p> It’s a great way to add physical activity to your day without having to block out time to exercise. If you are aiming for the recommended 10,000 steps each day, taking the stairs counts toward that total.</p>

           <p> All of these small steps can add up to a healthier you.</p>

        <li><strong> Stretch it out</strong></li>
        <p> Regularly stretching your muscles helps you avoid injuries, stay limber and move freely as you age.</p>

        <p> Take a few minutes to stretch out before and after you exercise. If you aren't working out that day, take a few stretch breaks. Find a quiet space in the office where you won't be disturbed. On the go? Look for natural opportunities in your daily routine to stretch, such as getting out of your car or reaching for items on a high shelf at the store.</p>

        <p> Stretching right before bed can also help you relieve tension and help you get to sleep.</p>

        </ol>


       <p><em> These simple tips can be implemented immediately by the majority of families. Get started right away; your physical health depends on it.</em></p>

       <p>It seems clear that physical activity has several health benefits.  However, we must not forget that it is just one part of a healthy lifestyle and for good health, we should also focus on eating a balanced diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, some dairy, nuts, pulses, eggs, lean meat and oily fish, and limit our intake of saturated fat, sugars and salt.</p>

       <p>When you're young, you can build the foundation for a lifetime of good health. When you're older, healthy habits can help you control any diseases you have and lower your risk of getting others in the future.</p>
