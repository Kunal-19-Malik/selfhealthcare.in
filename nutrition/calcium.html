        <h1>Calcium</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Calcium is a nutrient that all living organisms need, including humans. It is the most abundant mineral in the body, and it is vital for bone health.
        </p>
        <p>
            Humans need calcium to build and maintain strong bones, and 99% of the body’s calcium is in the bones and teeth. It is also necessary for maintaining healthy communication between the brain and other parts of the body. It plays a role in muscle movement and cardiovascular function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Calcium occurs naturally in many foods, and food manufacturers add it to certain products. Supplements are also available.
        </p>
        <p>Alongside calcium, people also need vitamin D, as this vitamin helps the body absorb calcium. Vitamin D comes from fish oil, fortified dairy products, and exposure to sunlight.
        </p>
        <p>It makes up much of your bones and teeth and plays a role in heart health, muscle function and nerve signaling.</p>
        <p>Every day, we lose calcium through our skin, nails, hair, sweat, urine and feces. Our bodies cannot produce its own calcium. That’s why it’s important to get enough calcium from the food we eat. When we don’t get the calcium our body needs, it is taken from our bones. This is fine once in a while, but if it happens too often, bones get weak and easier to break.</p>

        <p> If you eat a varied and balanced diet, you don’t have to think too much about getting enough calcium. But if you’re avoiding milk and other dairy products because you’re lactose intolerant, or you’ve chosen to eat a plant-based diet, you might like to know which other foods can help provide you with your daily intake.
        </p>

        <h1>Health Benefits</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Calcium plays various roles in the body. These include the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bone health:</strong>
                <p> Around 99% of the calcium in the human body is in the bones and teeth. Calcium is essential for the development, growth, and maintenance of bone.</p>
                
                <p> As children grow, calcium contributes to the development of their bones. After a person stops growing, calcium continues to help maintain the bones and slow down bone density loss, which is a natural part of the aging process.</p>
                
                <p> Females who have already experienced menopause can lose bone density at a higher rate than males or younger people. They have a higher risk of developing osteoporosis, and a doctor may recommend calcium supplements.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Muscle contraction:</strong>
                    <p> Calcium helps regulate muscle contraction. When a nerve stimulates a muscle, the body releases calcium. The calcium helps the proteins in muscle carry out the work of contraction.</p>
                    
                    <p> When the body pumps the calcium out of the muscle, the muscle will relax.</p> </li>

                    <li><strong>Cardiovascular system:</strong>
                        <p> Calcium plays a key role in blood clotting. The process of clotting is complex and has a number of steps. These involve a range of chemicals, including calcium.</p>
                        
                        <p> Calcium’s role in muscle function includesTrusted Source maintaining the action of the heart muscle. Calcium relaxes the smooth muscle that surrounds blood vessels. Various studies have indicated a possible link between high consumption of calcium and lower blood pressure.</p>
                        </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Calcium is a co-factor for many enzymes. Without calcium, some key enzymes cannot work efficiently.</p>

        <p>Studies have also suggested that consuming enough calcium can result in:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Improved cholesterol values </li>
            <li> Lower risk of developing conditions involving high blood pressure during pregnancy</li>
                <li> Lower blood pressure in young people</li>
                <li> Lower blood pressure in those whose mothers who consumed enough calcium during pregnancy</li>
                <li> Lower risk of colorectal adenomas, a type of non-cancerous tumor </li>
                </li>
        </ul>

           <em> Consuming an adequate amount of calcium may have the following benefits.</em></p>

      <div class="headings" id="deficiency">
        <h1>Deficiency</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Blood levels of calcium are tightly regulated. Bones will release calcium into the blood if the diet does not provide enough, and no symptoms usually occur. A more serious deficiency of calcium, called hypocalcemia, results from diseases such as kidney failure, surgeries of the digestive tract like gastric bypass, or medications like diuretics that interfere with absorption.
        </p>
        <p>A gradual, progressive calcium deficiency can occur in people who do not get enough dietary calcium in the long-term or who lose the ability to absorb calcium. The first early stage of bone loss is called osteopenia and, if untreated, osteoporosis follows. </p>

        <p>The following are common signs of a deficiency: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Muscle cramps or weakness</li>
            <li>Numbness or tingling in fingers </li>
            <li>Abnormal heart rate </li>
            <li>Poor appetite</li>
        </ul>

           <p>If we do not have enough calcium in our diets to keep our bodies functioning, calcium is removed from where it is stored in our bones. Over time, this causes our bones to grow weaker and may lead to osteoporosis — a disorder in which bones become very fragile.</p>

      <div class="headings" id="toxicity-dosage">
        <h1>Toxicity and Dosage</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Just as a deficiency in calcium can cause health complications, excessive intake can also lead to negative side effects.
 </p>
        <p>Too much calcium in the blood is called hypercalcemia.</p>

        <p> The Upper Limit (UL) for calcium is 2,500 mg daily from food and supplements. People over the age of 50 should not take more than 2,000 mg daily.</p>
        <p>There are different types of supplements. A doctor can recommend the best option. This will depend on the individual’s needs and preferences, any medical conditions they have, and whether they are taking any medications.</p>
        <p>Elemental calcium is the pure mineral, but calcium in its natural form exists with other compounds.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Types of supplements</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calcium carbonate:</strong> This contains 40% elemental calcium. This type is commonly available, and it is relatively cheap and convenient. A person should take it with food, as stomach acid helps the body absorb it.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Calcium lactate:</strong> This contains 13% elemental calcium.</li>

            <li><strong>Calcium gluconate:</strong> This contains 9% elemental calcium.</li>

            <li><strong>Calcium citrate:</strong> This contains 21% elemental calcium. A person can take it with or without food. It is useful for people with inflammatory bowel disease, achlorhydria, and some absorption disorders.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Symptoms of toxicity include:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Kidney problems</li> 
           <li>Kidney stones</li>
           <li>Calcification of soft tissues and blood vessels</li>
           <li>Constipation</li>
        </ul>
            
          
        <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

        <h1>Sources</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, cow’s milk isn’t the only or a crucial source for calcium. There are many plant-based sources of calcium that can be used to make quick snacks or elaborate delicious meals! </p>

        <p>People can get the recommended daily amount of calcium by eating a healthy diet that includes a variety of calcium-rich foods. Milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy products are the biggest food sources of calcium. </p>
        

        <p>Good sources of calcium include:</p>

        <ul>
           <li> Milk</li>
           <li> Tofu </li>
           <li> Yogurt</li>
            <li> Cheese </li>
            <li> Fortified fruit juices </li>
            <li> Legumes and grains </li>
            <li> Sardines and salmon </li>
            <li> Cornmeal and corn tortillas </li>
            <li> Many fortified breakfast cereals </li>
            <li> Fortified dairy alternatives, such as soy milk</li>
            <li> Nuts and seeds, especially almonds, sesame, and chia </li>
            <li> Green leafy vegetables, such as broccoli, turnip leaves, watercress, and kale </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Some foods make it harder for the body to absorb calcium. In particular, sodas and carbonated beverages should be avoided, not just for bone health but for many nutritional reasons, including preventing obesity. Sodas decrease calcium absorption in the intestines and contain empty calories. Milk, calcium-fortified juices, and water are better beverage alternatives for all age groups.</p>
        <p><em> A diet rich in calcium is an essential step toward good health and disease prevention. </em></p>
