        <h1>What is nutrition, and why it is so important.</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Nutrition is the study of nutrients in food, how the body uses
          them, and the relationship between diet, health, and disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better
          nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal
          health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and
          childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as
          diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Healthy children learn better. People with adequate nutrition
          are more productive and can create opportunities to gradually
          break the cycles of poverty and hunger.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a class="hyperlink" href="../index.html">Self Health Care</a> is providing
          scientific advice and decision-making tools that can help
          people to take action to address all forms of malnutrition to
          support health and wellbeing for all, at all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nutritionists use ideas from molecular biology, biochemistry,
          and genetics to understand how nutrients affect the human
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nutrition also focuses on how people can use dietary choices
          to reduce the risk of disease, what happens if a person has
          too much or too little of a nutrient, and how allergies work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nutrients provide nourishment. Proteins, carbohydrates, fat,
          vitamins, minerals, fibre, and water are all nutrients. If
          people do not have the right balance of nutrients in their
          diet, their risk of developing certain health conditions
          increases.

        <h1>Type of Nutrients</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          On the basis of the quantity of nutrients in food, nutrients
          are of two types:
        </p>

        <h2>Macronutrients</h2>
        <p>
          Macronutrients are nutrients that people need in relatively
          large quantities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Macronutrients are the basic food components for the living
          organisms which are required in large amounts for proper
          maintaining the body. Macro-nutrients include carbohydrate,
          lipids or fats and proteins. They act as a main source of
          energy (sugars, amino acids) for the living organisms.
        </p>

        <h2>Micronutrients</h2>
        <p>
          Micronutrients are essential in small amounts. They include
          vitamins and minerals. Manufacturers sometimes add these to
          foods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Micronutrients are necessary substances for the living
          organisms which are required in small amount for the
          maintenance of the body, This type of nutrients plays a great
          role in the growth and development of living organisms. The
          lack of micronutrients can lead to various diseases to the
          organisms.

        <h1>Types of Food</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Food can be divided into two types according to their function
          in the body :
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Proximate Principles of Food:</li>
          <p>
            The food substances which help in energy production, body
            growth and maintenance of life are known as proximate
            principles of food such as carbohydrate, protein, fat or
            lipid.
          </p>
          <li>Protective Principles of Food:</li>
          <p>
            The food substances which prevent the body from the attack
            of various diseases are known as Protective Principles of
            Food. These types of food are also known as secondary food
            which helps in the metabolism of food. These types of food
            are vitamins, minerals, salt, and water.
          </p>

      <div class="headings" id="types-of-nutrition">
        <h1>Types of Nutrition</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>There are two types of nutrition:</p>

        <h4>Autotrophic Nutrition</h4>
        <p>
          It is a process by which green plants and some bacteria can
          produce their own food from simple inorganic substances like
          water, mineral salts and carbon dioxide by the process of
          photosynthesis using solar energy.
        </p>

        <h4>Heterotrophic Nutrition</h4>
        <p>
          Non-autotrophic organisms depend on autotrophic organisms for
          their food which is known as heterotrophs. Heterotrophs are
          animal and non-photosynthetic plants which cannot produce
          their own food. Nutrition exhibited by heterotrophs is known
          as heterotrophic nutrition.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Heterotrophic Nutrition</h2>
        <p>There are four types of heterotrophic nutrition such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Holozoic Nutrition</li>
          <li>Saprophytic Nutrition</li>
          <li>Parasitic Nutrition</li>
          <li>Symbiotic Nutrition</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Holozoic Nutrition</h4>
        <p>
          The term ‘holozoic’ comes from ‘holo’ meaning whole and
          ‘zoikos’ meaning animals where the animals take their food
          whole. It is one type of heterotrophic nutrition. In this
          case, organisms take solid or liquid food through the
          digestive system and break down into small pieces to be
          absorbed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, this type of nutrition consists of the following
          stages: ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation, and
          ingestion. Most of the animals show this type of nutrition.
        </p>

        <h4>Saprophytic Nutrition</h4>
        <p>
          When organisms feed on dead and decaying organic remains of
          other organisms to get energy, then it is known as saprophytic
          nutrition. This type of nutrition helps to clean the
          environment. In this case, organisms receive their nourishment
          from the dead and decomposed organic substance formed as a
          result of the decay of plant and animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Organisms secrets certain enzymes which digest the decayed
          organic substances and this simplified food in liquid
          condition is absorbed by the saprophytes later on. Fungi,
          moulds, some bacteria, and some protists obtain their food
          from dead and decaying organic matters and they are known as
          saprophytes.
        </p>

        <h4>Parasitic Nutrition</h4>
        <p>
          The process by which a living organism (parasites) obtains its
          necessary nutrient from any other plants or animals (host) is
          known as parasitic nutrition.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, parasites obtain the nutrients from the host
          body and parasites are harmful to the host body and even kill
          the hosts. Example: Human louse, tapeworm etc.
        </p>

        <h4>Symbiotic Nutrition</h4>
        <p>
          When two organisms live in close association with each other
          for their mutual benefit in nutrition, then the type of
          nutrition is known as symbiotic nutrition. Each of the pair
          organisms is called symbiont and the mode of their association
          is termed as symbiosis. Symbiotic nutrition is of two types:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <strong><li>Mutualism</li></strong>
          <p>
            When two organisms live in close association for their
            mutual benefits in obtaining their nutrition, the type of
            nutrition is called mutualism. e.g. Lichen. This is formed
            of an alga and a fungus. The alga obtains water, CO2, and
            minerals from the fungus whereas the fungus draws in
            carbohydrate type of food matters and O2 from the alga. The
            fungus protects the alga from drying up.
          </p>
          <strong><li>Commensalism</li></strong>
          <p>
            When two organisms living together and obtain their
            nutrition independently then the type of nutrition is known
            as commensalism. In this case, one organism gets benefits
            and other is unaffected.
          </p>

        <p>Nutrition is the study of food and how it affects the body. People need to consume a varied diet to obtain a wide range of nutrients.</p>
        <p>
          Some people choose to follow a specific diet, in which they focus on certain foods and avoid others. People who do this may need to plan carefully to ensure they obtain all the necessary vitamins to maintain their health.
        </p>
          <p><em>
            A diet that is rich in plant-based foods and that limits added animal fats, processed foods, and added sugar and salt is most likely to benefit a person’s health.</em></p>
