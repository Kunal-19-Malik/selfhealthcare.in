                <h1>Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Vitamin B5 commercially well-known as D-pantothenic acid or pantothenate is one of the potent water-soluble vitamins of the vitamin B complex. The word pantothenic comes from the Greek word "pantou," which means ‘everywhere’, as almost all foods contain small quantities of pantothenic acid in them.</p>
                <p>
                     It’s necessary for making blood cells, and it helps you convert the food you eat into energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is extremely beneficial for human life as it facilitates the body in breaking down food i.e. complex carbohydrates into simple forms of sugar i.e. glucose, and fats and proteins which in turn provides energy for carrying out various bodily activities. It also helps in making new red blood cells, synthesize cholesterol and a wide number of hormones in the adrenal glands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B5 or pantothenic acid plays a significant role in the conversion of energy for various bodily activities. It also takes part in the conversion of the various other B vitamins into forms which is acceptable by the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your body needs pantothenic acid to synthesize cholesterol. A derivative of pantothenic acid called pantethine is being studied to see if it may help lower cholesterol levels in the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B5 deficiency is rare, but may include symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, depression, irritability, vomiting, stomach pains, burning feet, and upper respiratory infections.
                </p>
                <p>Pantothenic acid is used for pantothenic acid deficiency. Dexpanthenol, a chemical similar to pantothenic acid, is used for skin irritation, nasal swelling and irritation, and other conditions. 
                </p>
                <p>In addition to playing a role in the breakdown of fats and carbohydrates for energy, vitamin B5 is critical to the manufacture of red blood cells, as well as sex and stress-related hormones produced in the adrenal glands, small glands that sit atop the kidneys. Vitamin B5 is also important in maintaining a healthy digestive tract, and it helps the body use other vitamins, particularly B2 (also called riboflavin). It is sometimes called the "anti-stress" vitamin, but there is no concrete evidence whether it helps the body withstand stress.</p>

                <p>
                    Vitamin B5, also called pantothenic acid, is one of the most important vitamins for human life. It’s necessary for making blood cells, and it helps you convert the food you eat into energy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B5 is a potent antioxidant and a neural compound which helps in boosting the immune system and neural functions. It also aids in metabolising fat and reducing stress levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several types of research show that regular intake of vitamin B5 reduces the pain and inflammation in the case of rheumatoid arthritis. It is also extremely beneficial for metabolising cholesterol. It keeps a healthy balance of the cholesterol levels in the blood. It lowers the level of bad cholesterol (i.e. LDL or Low-Density Lipoprotein) and ups the level of good cholesterol (i.e. HDL or High-Density Lipoprotein). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also used for various skin problems like itching, diaper rash, insect stings, bites, infection, etc. It is also useful in preventing and treating skin reactions to radiation therapy.
                </p>
                

                <p>This vitamin has many functions, including:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Converting food into glucose</li>
                  <li>Synthesizing cholesterol</li>
                  <li>Forming sex and stress-related hormones</li>
                  <li>Forming red blood cells</li>
                  <li>Skin Care</li>
                  <li>Synthesizing coenzyme A</li>
                  <li>Maintain a healthy digestive tract</li>
                  <li>May Reduce Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis</li>
                  <li>Process other vitamins, particularly B2 (riboflavin)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because pantothenic acid helps to break down fats, it has been studied for a potential role in reducing cholesterol levels in people who have dyslipidemia. </p>
                <p>
                    As with all B vitamins, pantothenic acid helps the body break down fats, carbohydrates, and proteins so that our bodies can use them for energy and rebuilding tissues, muscles, and organs.
                </p>

                <h1>Deficiency</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B5 deficiency is extremely rare in people as pantothenic acid is found in nearly all foods. A healthy and varied diet should provide a person with enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like other B complexes, vitamin B5 is also essential for providing energy to the body for carrying out various bodily functions. Hence, the lack of it can decrease the metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates leading to underlying deficiency syndromes. Although extremely rare, there are certain cases where unhealthy or poor diet has led to severe deficiency conditions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reduced levels of energy due to lack of vitamin B5 may cause fatigue, irritability, etc. It can also cause an imbalance in the sugar levels by reducing the sugar level below normal. Deficiency symptoms are also characterized by nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps restlessness, malaise, numbness, paraesthesia, muscle cramps, and sleep disturbances.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because pantothenic acid is found in a wide variety of foods, a deficiency is rare except in people who have other nutrient deficiencies, as seen with severe malnutrition. Other rare cases are seen in persons with genetic mutations in which pantothenic acid cannot be metabolized.
                </p>

                
                


                <p>The are some of the symptoms naicin deficiency:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Tiredness</li>
                  <li>Apathy</li>
                  <li>Depression</li>
                  <li>Irritability</li>
                  <li>Sleep Disorder</li>
                  <li>Burning Feet</li>
                  <li>Numbness</li>
                  <li>Muscle Cramps</li>
                  <li>Upper respiratory infection</li>
                </ul>

                <hr>
                <p>It is highly unlikely to have toxicity in the case of vitamin B5.</p>
                <p>
                    A toxic level of pantothenic acid has not been observed from food sources. With very large daily doses of 10 grams a day, stomach upset or mild diarrhea has been reported. However, this is rare and a Tolerable Upper Intake Level for pantothenic acid has not been established. 
                </p>
                <p> The Recommended Dietary Intake of vitamin B5 is 5mg for adults.  </p>
                
                <p>
                    Vitamin B5 supplements are mostly prescribed to be taken with water, preferably after eating.

                <p>
                    The best way to make sure you’re getting enough vitamin B5 is to eat a healthy, balanced diet every day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B5 is extremely vital for the healthy functioning of the body. Unlike the fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E and K, this water-soluble vitamin is produced in very minute quantity in the body, hence to fulfil the dietary needs one has to strictly depend on external food sources and supplements. And much to our respite, Mother Nature has blessed us with a bountiful amount of natural food sources laden with vitamin B5 that suffices our daily requirements of this healthful nutrient.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some good sources of pantothenic acid include mushrooms, legumes and lentils, avocados, milk, eggs, cabbage, organ meats such as liver and kidneys, white and sweet potatoes, whole-grain cereals and yeast.
                </p>
                <p>Pantothenic acid is found in almost all plant and animal foods to some degree, because the vitamin is found in all living cells.</p>

                <p>Here are some food sources of vitamin B5:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>mushrooms</li>
                    <li>Avocado</li>
                    <li>Nuts, Seeds</li>
                    <li>Yogurt</li>
                    <li>Dairy Milk</li>
                    <li>Eggs</li>
                    <li>Brown Rice</li>
                    <li>Oats</li>
                    <li>Fortified cereals</li>
                    <li>Organ meats (liver, kidney)</li>
                    <li>Chicken Breast</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Vitamin B5 is very stable and does not gets destroyed easily, hence the food sources can be cooked and consumed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Breads and cereals are often fortified with pantothenic acid.
                  Fortified means the vitamin has been added to the food.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <em>
                    A diet rich in vitamin B5 is an essential step toward good
                    health and disease prevention.
