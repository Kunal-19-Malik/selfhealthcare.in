                <h1>Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Vitamin B6 is a vitamin that benefits the central nervous system and metabolism. Its roles include turning food into energy and helping to create neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine.</p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B6 is one of eight B vitamins. This group of vitamins is important for proper cell function. They help with metabolism, creating blood cells, and keeping cells healthy.</p>
                <p>
                    Also known as pyridoxine, vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin, which means it dissolves in water. The body does not store vitamin B6 and releases any excess in urine, so people need to get enough vitamin B6 every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s significant to protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolism and the creation of red blood cells and neurotransmitters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B6 is extremely essential for healthy brain development and boosting the immune system. It holds high significance in helping the body to produce neurotransmitters like norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and serotonin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B6 is the common generic name given to six compounds (i.e. vitamers) with vitamin B6 activity such as pyridoxine, i.e. alcohol; pyridoxal, i.e. an aldehyde; and pyridoxamine, which contains an amino group; and their respective 5’-phosphate esters. Pyridoxamine 5’ phosphate (i.e. PMP) and pyridoxal 5’ phosphate (i.e. PLP) are the active coenzyme forms of vitamin B6. 
                </p>
                <p>Both the active forms of vitamin B6 i.e. PLP and PMP assists as coenzymes in several enzymatic reactions including amino acid, glucose, and lipid metabolism. It also plays a key role in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, metabolism of nutrients, synthesis and function of histamines, haemoglobin, neurotransmitters and also in the expression of genes.
                </p>
                <p>Vitamin B6 also facilitates the body in breaking down food i.e. complex carbohydrates into simple forms of sugar i.e. glucose, fats and proteins which in turn provides energy for carrying out various bodily activities. It also synthesizes amino acids and proteins and helps in the formation of the myelin sheath that surrounds the nerves.</p>

                <p>
                    Vitamin B6 is a potent neural compound that is extremely essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters. It is also required for the proper growth, development and functioning of the brain, nerves, skin, and other parts of the body. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B6 has been widely studied for its role in disease prevention. The vitamin in supplement form shows the most promise for the treatment of pregnancy-induced nausea, but such use should only occur under the supervision of a physician. Adequate blood levels of B6 may be associated with lower risk of cancers, compared to low blood levels. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consuming adequate amounts of vitamin B6 is important for optimal health and may even prevent and treat chronic diseases.  
                </p>
                <p>B6 vitamin plays a significant role in boosting heart health. It effectively reduces cholesterol and prevents the risk of cholesterol-related heart issues like heart block, atherosclerosis, heart attacks, etc. It lowers high blood pressure and prevents heart failure. </p>
                
                

                <p>This vitamin has many functions, including:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>May Improve Mood and Reduce Symptoms of Depression
                </li>
                  <li>May Promote Brain Health and Reduce Alzheimer’s Risk
                </li>
                  <li>May Prevent and Treat Anemia by Aiding Hemoglobin Production
                </li>
                  <li>May Be Useful in Treating Symptoms of PMS</li>
                  <li>May Help Treat Nausea During Pregnancy</li>
                  <li>May Prevent Clogged Arteries and Reduce Heart Disease Risk
                </li>
                  <li>May Help Prevent Cancer</li>
                  <li>May Reduce Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis</li>
                  <li>May Promote Eye Health and Prevent Eye Diseases
                </li>
                <li>May Treat Inflammation Associated With Rheumatoid Arthritis
                </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Vitamin B6 is a powerful antioxidant and hence helps to scavenge harmful free radicals from the body and thus preventing oxidative damage. It also rejuvenates the skin, reduces various signs of ageing like wrinkles, fine lines, spots, dark circles etc. </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B6 has potent anti-inflammatory properties. Regular intake of this vitamin through food sources reduces the pain and inflammation in the case of rheumatoid arthritis. In supplement form, it also prevents the risk of kidney stones in people suffering from hyperoxaluria.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Deficiency syndromes due to vitamin B6 is quite uncommon but a severe lack of this significant vitamin may cause electroencephalographic abnormalities, microcytic anaemia, glossitis (swollen tongue), dermatitis with cheilosis (scaling on the lips and cracks at the corners of the mouth), conjunctivitis, intertrigo, depression, confusion, and weakened immune function. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kids and infants having a lack of vitamin B6 develop abnormally acute hearing, irritability and convulsive seizures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Many deficiencies in vitamin B6 are associated with low levels of other B vitamins, such as vitamin B12 and folate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Long-term, excessive alcohol consumption may eventually result in a B6 deficiency, as can hypothyroidism and diabetes.
                </p>

                
                


                <p>A vitamin B6 deficiency most often occurs when other B vitamins in the body are low, particularly vitamin B12 and folic acid. A mild deficiency may have no symptoms, but a more severe or prolonged deficiency can exhibit the following:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Peripheral neuropathy with tingling, numbness, and pain in the hands and feet
                </li>
                  <li>Anemia</li>
                  <li>Depression</li>
                  <li>Seizures</li>
                  <li>Confusion</li>

                <h1>Toxicity and Dosage</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    It is quite unlikely to reach a toxic level of vitamin B6 from food sources alone. Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin so that unused amounts will exit the body through the urine. However, a toxic level can occur from long-term very high dose supplementation of greater than 1,000 mg daily.  
                </p>

                <p> Taking vitamin B6 in doses of 100 mg daily or less is generally considered to be safe. Vitamin B6 is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken in doses of 101-200 mg daily.  </p>
                
                <p>
                    Although lack of vitamin B6 causes a lot of deficiency syndromes, it is also not beneficial to overload your body with too much od vitamin B6 foods or supplements.  
                </p>

                <p>Anything more than the recommended amount can cause severe and progressive sensory neuropathy characterized by ataxia (loss of control of bodily movements), painful disfiguring dermatological lesions, photosensitivity, and gastric issues.</p>
                
                <p>Some common side effects are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                  <li>Diarrhea</li>
                  <li>Stomach trouble</li>
                  <li>Vomiting</li>
                  <li>Excessive Stress</li>
                  <li>Headache</li>
                  <li>Sleepiness and heartburn</li>
                  <li>Nausea</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Symptoms usually subside after stopping the high dosage.</p>
                                
                <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

                <p>
                    The mood-control vitamin is extremely vital for the healthy functioning of the brain and body. Like any other water-soluble vitamins, this B6 vitamin also gets washed away from the body, hence one should consume a diet rich in vitamin B6 food options to prevent the deficiency syndromes.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Excellent food sources that serve up the vitamin B6 you need include chickpeas, beef, poultry, and fish. Other foods that are high in B6 are whole grains, fortified cereals, nuts, beans, bananas, and potatoes.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B6 is usually included in multivitamins and sold as an individual supplement; it may be listed as pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxine hydrochloride, or pyridoxal-5-phosphate. 
                </p>
                <p>Most foods have some vitamin B6. People with a well-balanced diet do not tend to develop a deficiency. Medical conditions and certain medications can lead to a deficiency.</p>

                <p>Here are some food sources of vitamin B6:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Dairy Products, such as milk, cheese</li>
                    <li>Potatoes</li>
                    <li>Chickpeas</li>
                    <li>Bananas</li>
                    <li>Yellowfin tuna</li>
                    <li>Nuts</li>
                    <li>Rice</li>
                    <li>Fish (Salmon)</li>
                    <li>Onion</li>
                    <li>Watermalon</li>
                    <li>Fortified foods, such as breakfast cereals
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Consuming adequate amounts of vitamin B6 is important for optimal health. </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B6 is very stable and does not gets destroyed easily, hence the food sources can be cooked and consumed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Breads and cereals are often fortified with pantothenic acid.
                  Fortified means the vitamin has been added to the food.
                </p>

                <p>
