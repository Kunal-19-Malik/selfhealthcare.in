        <h1>Protein</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Protein is a macronutrient that is essential to building muscle mass. It is commonly found in animal products, though is also present in other sources, such as nuts and legumes. </p>

        <p> There are three macronutrients: protein, fats and carbohydrates. Macronutrients provide calories, or energy. The body requires large amounts of macronutrients to sustain life, hence the term “macro,” according to the University of Illinois McKinley Health Center. Each gram of protein contains 4 calories. Protein makes up about 15 percent of a person’s body weight.</p>

        <p> Chemically, protein is composed of amino acids, which are organic compounds made of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and proteins are the building blocks of muscle mass, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). </p>

        <p> “When protein is broken down in the body it helps to fuel muscle mass, which helps metabolism," said Jessica Crandall, a registered dietitian nutritionist, certified diabetes educator and national spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. "It also helps the immune system stay strong. It helps you stay full. A lot of research has shown that protein has satiety effects.” </p>

       <p> The 20 amino acids that the body uses to create protein are:</p>
        <ul>
       <li> Alanine </li>
       <li> Arginine </li>
       <li> Asparagine </li>
       <li> Aspartic acid </li>
       <li> Cysteine </li>
       <li> Glutamic acid </li>
       <li> Glutamine </li>
       <li> Glycine </li>
       <li> Histidine </li>
       <li> Isoleucine </li>
       <li> Leucine </li>
       <li> Lysine </li>
       <li> Methionine </li>
       <li> Phenylalanine </li>
       <li> Proline </li>
       <li> Serine </li>
       <li> Threonine </li>
       <li> Tryptophan </li>
       <li> Tyrosine </li>
       <li> Valine </li>
        </ul>
       <p> There are nine essential amino acids that the human body does not synthesize, so they must come from the diet.</p>

       <p> Proteins may be either complete or incomplete. Complete proteins are proteins that contain all essential amino acids. Animal products, soy, and quinoa are complete proteins.</p>

       <p> Incomplete proteins are proteins that do not contain all essential amino acids. Most plant foods are incomplete proteins, including beans, nuts, and grains.</p>

       <p> People can combine incomplete protein sources to create a meal that provides all essential amino acids. Examples include rice and beans, or peanut butter on whole wheat bread.</p>

        <h1>Source of Protein</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> A healthful eating pattern includes a variety of foods containing protein. Both animal and plant foods can be excellent sources of protein.</p>

        <p> The guidelines classify the following foods as protein foods:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Seafood</li>
        <li> Lean meats and poultry</li>
        <li> Eggs</li>
        <li> Legumes, which include beans and peas</li>
        <li> Nuts</li>
        <li> Seeds</li>
        <li> Soy products</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, also contain protein. Whole grains and vegetables contain some protein, but generally less than other sources.</p>

        <p> Animal products tend to contain higher amounts of protein than plant foods, so people following a vegetarian diet or a vegan diet may need to plan their meals to ensure they meet their protein needs.</p>

        <p> The FDA advise that people can tell if a food product is high or low in protein by checking the label.</p>

        <p> Foods that provide 5% or less of a person’s daily value (DV) are considered low in protein.</p>

        <p> Foods with 20% DV or more are considered high in protein.</p>

        <p> A person does not need to consume foods containing all the essential amino acids at each meal because their body can use amino acids from recent meals to form complete proteins. Eating a variety of protein foods throughout the day is the best way for a person to meet their daily protein needs.</p>

      <div class="headings" id="Protein Deficiency">
        <h1>Protein Deficiency</h1>
        <hr>
        
        <p> Protein deficiency due to a low intake of protein in the diet is unusual.</p>

        <p> However, a lack of protein in other countries is a serious concern, especially in children. Protein deficiency can lead to malnutrition, such as kwashiorkor and marasmus, which can be life threatening.</p>

        <p> Protein deficiency can arise if a person has a health condition, including:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> An eating disorder, such as anorexia nervosa</li>
        <li> Certain genetic conditions</li>
        <li> Advanced stages of cancer</li>
        <li> Difficulty absorbing nutrients due to a health issue such as</li> 
        <li> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or gastric bypass
             surgery </li>             
    </ul>
        
        <p> Very low protein intake can lead to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Weak muscle tone </li>
        <li> Edema or swelling due to fluid retention </li>
        <li> Thin, brittle hair </li>
        <li> Skin lesions </li>
        <li> In adults, a loss of muscle mass </li>
        <li> In children, growth deficits </li>
        <li> Hormone imbalances </li>
    </ul>

      <div class="headings" id="Protein vs. Natural Food">
        <h1>Protein Shakes vs. Natural Food Sources</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Protein shakes and protein powders contain high amounts of protein. Protein powders may contain 10–30 g of protein per scoop. They may also contain added sugars, flavorings, vitamins, and minerals.</p>

        <p> Protein in protein shakes or powders can come from:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Plants, such as peas or soybeans</li>
        <li> Milk, such as casein or whey protein</li>
        <li> Eggs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> Building and repairing muscle requires protein. Many athletes and bodybuilders use protein products to boost muscle growth.</p>
        
        <p> A wide range of protein supplements is currently available, many claiming to encourage weight loss and increase muscle mass and strength.</p>
        
         <p> Taking protein supplements significantly improved muscle size and strength in healthy adults who do resistance exercise, such as weight lifting.</p>
        
        <p> However, protein shakes and powders count as dietary supplements, and so they are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means people cannot guarantee that the products contain what the manufacturer claims they do.</p>
        
        <p> Some supplements may also contain banned or unhealthy substances, such as heavy metals or pesticides.</p>
        
        <p> Many protein products are high in added sugar and calories, which can lead to spikes in blood sugar and weight gain, so it is important to check the labels.</p>
        
        <p> Most people, including athletes, can get enough protein from a balanced diet without supplements. Getting too much protein consistently can cause serious health problems.</p>
        
        <p> Some people may benefit from using protein powder to address health concerns, including those with:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> A reduced appetite, which may result from older age or cancer treatment</li>
        <li> A wound that is not healing well, as protein can help the body repair and replace cells</li>
        <li> A medical condition, such as a serious burn, that requires additional calories and protein</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Protein is an important part of every diet. The FDA recommend that adults consume 50 grams (g) of protein per day as part of a 2,000-calorie diet, though a person’s specific needs depend on their age, sex, activity levels, and other factors.</p>

          <p><em> A healthy, well-balanced diet is a great way to provide your body with a safe amount of this essential nutrient.</em></p>
