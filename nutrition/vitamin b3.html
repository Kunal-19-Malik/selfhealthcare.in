                <h1>Vitamin B3 (Niacin)</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  Vitamin B3, also known as niacin or niacinamide, is an
                  important nutrient. In fact, every part of your body needs it
                  to function properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Niacin is a form of vitamin B3. It is found in foods such as
                  yeast, meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, and cereal
                  grains. Niacin is also produced in the body from tryptophan,
                  which is found in protein-containing food. When taken as a
                  supplement, niacin is often found in combination with other B
                  vitamins.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Niacin is absorbed by the body when dissolved in water and
                  taken by mouth. It is converted to niacinamide if taken in
                  amounts greater than what is needed by the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Niacin is required for the proper function of fats and sugars
                  in the body and to maintain healthy cells. At high doses,
                  niacin might help people with heart disease because of its
                  beneficial effects on clotting. It may also improve levels of
                  a certain type of fat called triglycerides in the blood.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Niacin deficiency can cause a condition called pellagra, which
                  causes skin irritation, diarrhea, and dementia. Pellagra was
                  common in the early twentieth century, but is less common now,
                  since some foods containing flour are now fortified with
                  niacin. Pellagra has been virtually eliminated in western
                  culture.
                </p>
                <p>"There are two main chemical forms and each has different effects on your body. 
                Both forms are found in foods as well as supplements."
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong> Nicotinic acid:</strong> As a supplement, nicotinic acid is a form of niacin used to reduce cholesterol levels and lower your risk of heart disease</li>
                    <li><strong>Niacinamide or nicotinamide:</strong> Unlike nicotinic acid, niacinamide doesn’t lower cholesterol.
                    However, it may help treat psoriasis and reduce your risk of non-melanoma skin
                    cancer.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It plays a role in converting the food we eat into energy. It helps the body to use proteins and fats, and it keeps the skin, hair, and nervous system healthy.</p>
                <p>
                  As a supplement, niacin may help lower cholesterol, ease
                  arthritis and boost brain function, among other benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, it can also cause serious side effects if you take
                  large doses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  People with poor diet, alcoholism, and some types of
                  slow-growing tumors called carcinoid tumors might be at risk for niacin deficiency.

                <p>
                    Vitamin B3 well known as Niacin is an essential nutrient for improving bodily functions. It plays a key role in lowering cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several studies show that regular intake of foods containing B3 vitamin helps in lowering the low-density lipoproteins (i.e. LDL or bad cholesterols) and effectively increases the high-density lipoproteins (i.e. HDL or good cholesterol).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Niacin or vitamin B3 is also used for treating various infections and extreme fluid loss conditions like diarrhoea, cholera, etc. It is also extremely effective in treating the hardening of the arteries i.e. atherosclerosis by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation and hence reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases like heart attack, stroke, angina, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B3 is also essential in improving the cognitive functioning of the brain. It helps in repairing the brain cells and in turn, is used for treating symptoms associated with psychotic conditions like brain fog, schizophrenia, depression, hallucinations, etc. It is also used for preventing and treating Alzheimer’s disease.
                </p>
                

                <p>This vitamin has many functions, including:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Lower LDL Cholestrol</li>
                  <li>Increase HDL Cholestrol</li>
                  <li>Lowers Triglycerides</li>
                  <li>May Help Prevent Heart Disease</li>
                  <li>May Help Treat Type 1 Diabetes</li>
                  <li>Boosts Brain Function</li>
                  <li>Improves Skin Function</li>
                  <li>May Reduce Symptoms of Arthritis</li>
                  <li>Treats Pellagra</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Vitamin B3 is extremely important for the healthy functioning of the gastrointestinal system by improving digestion, proper absorption of the food juices into the body and excretion of the waste products from the intestines. It also prevents constipation and reduces flatulence.

                    Vitamin B3 is a quintessential ingredient required for the healthy functioning of the body and treating a host of ailments. Lack of this potent vitamin can cause severe health problems. Nowadays, several developing countries are also facing vitamin B3 deficiencies due to a rising number of populations suffering from malnutrition, poverty, and alcoholism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most common deficiency due to lack of vitamin B3 is pellagra which shows visible symptoms like diarrhoea, dermatitis, hyperpigmentation, thickening of the skin, inflammation of the mouth and tongue, digestive disturbances, dementia. It also shows lesions on the lower neck which is known as Casal's necklace lesions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Several studies also characterize digestive pain, vomiting, nausea, irritable bowel syndrome and constipation as some of the symptoms due to lack of vitamin B3 rich foods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sometimes, a severe lack of vitamin B3 may also cause amnesia, delirium, and other psychotic symptoms like anxiety, fatigue, restlessness, irritability, poor concentration, apathy, depression and eventually, if not treated on time, can lead to death.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vitamin B3 or Niacin deficiency can also cause Hartnup disease characterized by scaly red rashes, irritation, and sensitivity towards sunlight.

                <p>
                    Vitamin B3 is extremely necessary for various functions in the body and the benefits can be enjoyed by adequate consumption of vitamin B3 rich foods. 
                </p>
                <p>There’s no danger in consuming niacin in the amounts found in food. </p>
                <p>
                    The Recommended Dietary Intake of Vitamin B3 is 16mg a day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is considered safe when consumed as a natural food source but when taken as a supplement without prior consultation more than the prescribed quantity. 
                </p>
                
                <p>Some common side effects of naicin:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Dizziness</li>
                  <li>Low Blood Pressure</li>
                  <li>Fatigue</li>
                  <li>Headache</li>
                  <li>Upset Stomach</li>
                  <li>Nausea</li>
                  <li>Blurred vision</li>
                  <li>reduce glucose tolerance and insulin resistance</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are also some serve side effects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Niacin flush:</strong>
                        Nicotinic acid supplements may cause a flush on the face, chest or neck that
                        results from blood vessel dilation. You may also experience a tingling, burning
                        sensation or pain. </li>
                        <li><strong>Stomach irritation and nausea:</strong> Nausea, vomiting and stomach irritation can
                            occur, particularly when people take slow-release nicotinic acid. It seems to
                            be related to elevated liver enzymes. </li>
                        <li><strong>Liver damage:</strong>
                            Long-term niacin treatment for cholesterol may cause liver damage. It’s more
                            common with slow-release nicotinic acid but can also result from the
                            immediate-release form. </li>
                        <li><strong>Blood sugar control:</strong> Large
                            doses of niacin of 3–9 grams per day are linked to impaired blood sugar control
                            in both short- and long-term use. </li>
                        <li><strong>Eye health:</strong> One rare side effect is
                            blurred vision, as well as other negative effects on eye health.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gout:</strong> Niacin can increase
                                levels of uric acid in your body, leading to gout. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Supplemental niacin can cause several side
                    effects, especially in large doses. The most common of these is niacin flush,
                    which can occur even at lower doses.</p>
                <p>
                    Toxicity when eating foods containing niacin is rare, but can occur from long-term use of high-dose supplements. A reddened skin flush with itchiness or tingling on the face, arms, and chest is a common sign. Flushing occurs mainly when taking high-dosage supplements in the form of nicotinic acid, rather than nicotinamide.
                </p>

                <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

                    Like any other water-soluble vitamins, this vitamin B3 complex also gets washed away from the body, hence one should consume a diet rich in vitamin B3 food options to prevent the deficiency syndromes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B3 is not only found in a variety of processed and fortified foods and energy drinks but also in innumerable natural food sources which suffices the daily Vitamin B3 requirements of the body.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Niacin is found in a variety of foods, especially meat, poultry, fish, nuts and legumes.
                </p>
                <p>Some energy drinks are also loaded with B vitamins, sometimes in very high doses.</p>

                <p>Here are some food sources of vitamin B3:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Red meat: beef, beef liver, pork</li>
                  <li>Fish (Salmon)</li>
                  <li>Poultry</li>
                  <li>Brown rice</li>
                  <li>Nuts, seeds</li>

                  <li>Fortified cereals and breads</li>

                <p>
                    Vitamin B3 is very stable and does not gets destroyed easily, hence the food sources can be cooked and consumed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Breads and cereals are often fortified with niacin.
                  Fortified means the vitamin has been added to the food.
