        <h1>Vitamin E (Tocopherol)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Vitamin E is a fat-soluble, essential nutrient with anti-inflammatory properties. Vitamin E helps support the immune system, cell function, and skin health. It’s an antioxidant, making it effective at combating the effects of free radicals produced by the metabolism of food and toxins in the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vitamin E is beneficial for reducing UV damage to skin.
        </p>
        <p> Its main role is to act as an antioxidant, scavenging loose electrons—so-called “free radicals”—that can damage cells.</p>
        <p>It may also be effective at reducing the symptoms of atopic dermatitis and fatty liver disease, and for slowing the progression of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
        <p>
            Vitamin E is even used to widen blood vessels, reducing the risk of blood clots.
        </p>
        <p>
            UV light and sun exposure reduce vitamin E levels in skin. Vitamin E levels also decrease with age. However, vitamin E is available in many foods, in supplement form, and as an ingredient in products applied topically.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Vitamin E has the ability to protect cells from free radical damage as well as reduce the production of free radicals in certain situations. However, conflicting study results have dimmed some of the promise of using high dose vitamin E to prevent chronic diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also enhances immune function and prevents clots from forming in heart arteries.
        </p>
        <p>
            The term “vitamin E” describes eight different compounds. Alpha-tocopherol is the most active one in humans.
        </p>

        <h1>Benefits</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Vitamin E is not a single vitamin, but rather a group of fat-soluble vitamins with antioxidant effects.
        </p>
        <p>Antioxidants fight free radicals, which are electrons that have broken off from an atom. Free radicals have been linked to a wide range of health conditions, from cancer to premature aging. </p>
        <p>Vitamin E potential benefits derive from two key features: its antioxidant properties, which could fight inflammation and slow the effects of free radicals, and its moisturizing properties.</p>
        <p>
            This vitamin has many functions, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong> Alzheimer disease:</strong> Taking vitamin E supplements doesn't seem to prevent Alzheimer disease from developing. However, in people who already have Alzheimer disease, taking vitamin E along with some anti-Alzheimer medicines might slow down the worsening of memory loss. Vitamin E might also delay the loss of independence and the need for caregiver assistance in people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease.</li>
            <li><strong> Blood disorder:</strong> It reduces levels of protein in the blood called hemoglobin (beta-thalassemia). Taking vitamin E by mouth seems to benefit children with the blood disorder called beta-thalassemia.
            </li>
            <li><strong> Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea):</strong> Taking vitamin E for 2 days before bleeding and for 3 days after bleeding starts seems to decrease pain and reduce menstrual blood loss. Taking vitamin E with fish oil might provide even more pain relief than taking vitamin E alone.
            </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some other benefits of Vitamin E are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Moisturizing skin</li>
            <li>Wound healing</li>
            <li>Skin cancer prevention</li>
            <li>Reducing skin itching</li>
            <li>Eczema</li>
            <li>Treating acne scarring</li>
            <li>Preventing aging and wrinkles on your face</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
           <em> Consuming an adequate amount of vitamin E may have the following benefits.</em></p>

      <div class="headings" id="deficiency">
        <h1>Deficiency</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Deficiency is uncommon and typically the result of an underlying condition. Some premature infants also have low levels.
        </p>
        <p>Because vitamin E is found in a variety of foods and supplements, deficiency is rare. People who have digestive disorders or do not absorb fat properly (e.g., pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease) can develop a vitamin E deficiency. </p>
        <p>The following are common signs of a deficiency: </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Muscle weakness:</strong> Vitamin E is essential to the central nervous system. It is among the body’s main antioxidants, and a deficiency results in oxidative stress, which can lead to muscle weakness.</li>
            <li><strong>Coordination and walking difficulties:</strong> A deficiency can cause certain neurons, called the Purkinje neurons, to break down, harming their ability to transmit signals.</li>
            <li><strong>Numbness and tingling:</strong> Damage to nerve fibers can prevent the nerves from transmitting signals correctly, resulting in these sensations, which are also called peripheral neuropathy.</li>
            <li><strong>Vision deterioration:</strong> A vitamin E deficiency can weaken light receptors in the retina and other cells in the eye. This can lead to loss of vision over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Immune system problems:</strong> Some research suggests that a lack of vitamin E can inhibit the immune cells. Older adults  may be particularly at risk.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="headings" id="toxicity-dosage">
        <h1>Toxicity and Dosage</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Eating vitamin E in foods is not risky or harmful. However, high doses of vitamin E supplements (alpha-tocopherol supplements) might increase the risk of bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). </p>
        <p>High levels of vitamin E may also increase the risk for birth defects. </p>
        <p>Low intake may lead to hemolytic anemia in premature babies. </p>
        <p>The highest safe level of vitamin E supplements for adults is 1,500 IU/day for natural forms of vitamin E, and 1,000 IU/day for the man-made (synthetic) form.</p>
        <p>There are many foods that are rich in vitamin E, so most people with a healthy diet consume enough from food alone. However, some people — like those with diseases that may impact their ability to absorb fat— may consider supplements. </p>
        <p>Although it's possible to have too much vitamin E in your diet, toxicity most often occurs due to unnecessary or excessive supplement use.  </p>    
        <p>Vitamin E toxicity has two stages of symptoms: mild and severe.  </p>
        
        <p>Signs of toxicity include the following:</p>   
        <ul>
            <li>Nausea</li>
            <li>Headache</li>
            <li>Abdominal cramps</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>Diarrhea</li>
        </ul>          
        <p>You should be able to get the amount of vitamin E you need by eating a varied and balanced diet.</p>
        <p>If you take vitamin E supplements, do not take too much as this could be harmful. </p>
        <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

        <h1>Sources</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Numerous foods provide vitamin E. Nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils are among the best sources of alpha-tocopherol, and significant amounts are available in green leafy vegetables and fortified cereals. </p>
        <p>Plentiful food sources of vitamin D include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Vegetable oils (such as wheat germ, sunflower, safflower, corn, and soybean oils)</li>
            <li>Nuts (such as almonds, peanuts, and hazelnuts/filberts)</li>
            <li>Seeds (such as sunflower seeds)</li>
            <li>Green leafy vegetables (such as spinach and broccoli)</li>
            <li>Fortified breakfast cereals, fruit juices, margarine, and spreads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fortified means that vitamins have been added to the food.</p>
        <p>Products made from these foods, such as margarine, also contain vitamin E.</p>
