        <h1>Molybednum</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Molybdenum is a trace mineral that your body uses to break down proteins and other substances. We get molybdenum from the foods we eat, the richest sources of which include peas, lentils, and other legumes. It is also found in grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, animal organs, and the water we drink.</p>

        <p>Once ingested, molybdenum is stored in the liver, kidneys, adrenal glands, and bone. It also found in the lungs, spleen, and skin. You don't need much molybdenum to aid in normal metabolism; in fact, around 90 percent of what you consume will be excreted in urine.</p>

        <p>Because we typically consume far more than we need, molybdenum deficiency is virtually unheard of. With that being said, molybdenum supplements are available, which some alternative practitioners believe may aid in the treatment or prevention of gout, asthma, bone loss, and even certain types of cancer.</p>

        <p>It is present in soil and transferred into your diet when you consume plants, as well as animals that feed on those plants.</p>

            <p> There is very little data on the specific molybdenum content of certain foods, as it depends on the content of the soil.</p>
            
            <p> Although amounts vary, the richest sources are usually beans, lentils, grains and organ meats, particularly liver and kidney. Poorer sources include other animal products, fruits and many vegetables.</p>
            
            <p> Studies have shown that your body doesn’t absorb it well from certain foods, particularly soy products. However, this is not considered a problem since other foods are so rich in it.</p>
            
            <p> Since your body only needs it in trace amounts and it’s abundant in many foods, molybdenum deficiency is rare. For this reason, people don’t usually need supplements, unless for some specific medical reasons.</p>
      </div>

        <h1>Health Benefits</h1>
        <hr>

        <p> Molybdenum acts as a cofactor for three groups of enzymes, meaning that it is needed for the enzymes to do their job. It is incorporated into a molecule called molybdopterin, whose role it is to enable the activity of xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and sulfite oxidase. These enzymes metabolize sulfur-containing amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines. Xanthine oxidsase and aldehyde oxidase, and another compound are involved with metabolizing drugs and toxins.</p>

        <p> In the unlikely event you have molybdenum deficiency, your body would not be able to process amino acids containing sulfur. This could trigger a condition known as sulfite sensitivity, in which you develop an asthma-like reaction to foods or beverages containing sulfites.</p>


        <p> Many of the benefits attributed to molybdenum supplements are based on the conceit that it will enhance the body's natural enzymic function, preventing or treating such conditions as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Sulfite allergy</li>
            <li> Asthma</li>
            <li> Gout</li>
            <li> Tooth decay</li>
            <li> Osteoporosis</li>
            <li> Esophageal cancer</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Given the high rate excretion from the body, it is unlikely that supplements can increase concentrations to levels considered therapeutic. In the end, the body can only store and utilize so much. Moreover, conditions like these may occasionally be associated with a molybdenum deficiency but are more likely to occur for other reasons.</p>


        <p> For example, sulfite sensitivity and asthma are both triggered by an abnormal immune response. Outside of molybdenum deficiency, taking a molybdenum supplement would do nothing to alter this effect.</p>

        <p> The same applies to gout. While molybdenum is often touted as a gout treatment, it actually breaks down purine in food and increases the amount of uric acid in the blood. High uric acid is associated with an increased, rather than decreased, risk of gout. Excessive intake of molybdenum is characterized by achy joints, gout-like symptoms, and abnormally high levels of uric acid.</p>


        <p> Similarly, while molybdeunum helps to maintain tooth enamel, there has been no evidence that supplementation can make teeth or bones stronger.</p>
        
        
        <em> Consuming an adequate amount of molybdenum may have the following benefits.</em></p>

      <div class="headings" id="deficiency">
        <h1>Deficiency</h1>
        <hr>

        <p> Although supplements are widely available, molybdenum deficiency is very rare in healthy people.</p>

        <p> The estimated average daily intake of molybdenum in the US is 76 micrograms per day for women and 109 micrograms per day for men.</p>

        <p> This exceeds the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults, which is 45 micrograms per day.</p>

        <p> Information on molybdenum intake in other countries varies, but it’s usually well above requirements.</p>

        <p> There have been a few exceptional cases of molybdenum deficiency, which have been linked to adverse health conditions.</p>

        <p> In one situation, a hospital patient was receiving artificial nutrition through a tube and not given any molybdenum. This resulted in severe symptoms, including fast heart rate and breathing, vomiting, disorientation and eventually coma.</p>

        <p> Long-term molybdenum deficiency has been observed in some populations and linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer.</p>

        <p> In one small region of China, esophageal cancer is 100 times more common than in the US. It has been discovered that the soil in this area contains very low levels of molybdenum, resulting in a long-term low dietary intake.</p>

        <p> Furthermore, in other areas that have a high risk of esophageal cancer, such as parts of northern Iran and South Africa, molybdenum levels in hair and nail samples have been found to be low.</p>

        <p> It is important to note that these are cases in individual populations, and deficiency is not an issue for most people.</p>

      <div class="headings" id="toxicity-dosage">
        <h1>Toxicity and Dosage</h1>
        <hr>

        <p> Molybdenum cofactor deficiency is a very rare genetic condition in which babies are born without the ability to make molybdenum cofactor.</p>

        <p> Therefore, they are unable to activate the four important enzymes mentioned above.</p>

        <p> It’s caused by a recessive, hereditary gene mutation, so a child would have to inherit the affected gene from both parents to develop it.</p>

        <p> Babies with this condition appear normal at birth, but become unwell within a week, experiencing seizures that don’t improve with treatment.</p>

        <p> Toxic levels of sulfite accumulate in their blood, since they are unable to convert it to sulfate. This leads to brain abnormalities and severe developmental delays.</p>

        <p> Sadly, babies who are affected do not survive past early childhood.</p>

        <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

        <hr>

        <p> Molybdenum is an essential mineral found in high concentrations in legumes, grains and organ meats.</p>

        <p> It activates enzymes that help break down harmful sulfites and prevent toxins from building up in the body.</p>
        
        <p> Situations in which people get too much or too little of the mineral are extremely rare, but both have been linked to serious adverse effects.</p>
        
        <p> Since molybdenum is found in many common foods, the average daily intake exceeds requirements. For this reason, most people should avoid supplementing with it.</p>
        
        <p> As long as you eat a healthy diet with a variety of whole foods, then molybdenum is not a nutrient to be concerned about.</p>
        
        <p><em> A healthy, well-balanced diet is a great way to provide your body with a safe amount of this essential nutrient.</em></p>
