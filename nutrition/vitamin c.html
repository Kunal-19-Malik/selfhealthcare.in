        <h1>Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Vitamin C is an essential vitamin, meaning your body can’t produce it. Yet, it has many roles and has been linked to impressive health benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vitamin C is also called ascorbic acid. It cannot be made by the human body and so is an essential component of your diet. Vitamin C is needed to make a substance called collagen which is required for the health.
        </p>
        <p> It’s water-soluble and found in many fruits and vegetables, including oranges, strawberries, kiwi fruit, bell peppers, broccoli, kale, and spinach.</p>
        <p>The human body cannot produce or store vitamin C. Therefore, it’s essential to consume it regularly in sufficient amounts.</p>
        <p>
            The recommended daily intake for vitamin C is 75 mg for women and 90 mg for men. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While it’s commonly advised to get your vitamin C intake from foods, many people turn to supplements to meet their needs.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Vitamin C is one of the safest and most effective nutrients, experts say. Though it may not be the cure for the common cold, the benefits of vitamin C may include protection against immune system deficiencies, cardiovascular disease, prenatal health problems, eye disease, and even skin wrinkling. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Deficiency symptoms include bleeding gums, frequent bruising and infections, poor wound healing, anemia and scurvy. 
        </p>
        <p>It’s well known for being a potent antioxidant, as well as having positive effects on skin health and immune function.</p>

        <h1> Benefits</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>There is interest in the antioxidant role of vitamin C, as research has found the vitamin to neutralize free radical molecules, which in excess can damage cells. 
        </p>
        <p>Due to its function as an antioxidant and its role in immune function, vitamin C has been promoted as a means to help prevent and/or treat numerous health conditions. This section focuses on four diseases and disorders in which vitamin C might play a role: cancer (including prevention and treatment), cardiovascular disease, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts, and the common cold.</p>
        <p>
            Vitamin C is also involved in the body’s immune system by stimulating the activity of white blood cells. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This vitamin has many functions, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>May reduce your risk of chronic disease</li>
            <li>May help manage high blood pressure</li>
            <li>May lower your risk of heart disease</li>
            <li>May reduce blood uric acid levels and help prevent gout attacks</li>
            <li>Helps prevent iron deficiency</li>
            <li>Boosts immunity</li>
            <li>Protects your memory and thinking as you age</li>
            <p>Individual requirements of Vitamin C doses are based on factors including age, gender, health status, and environmental changes. The daily requirement of Vitamin C is 90 mg in adult males, 75 mg in adult female, and 120 mg in the pregnant female.</p>
            </ul>

          <p> <em> Consuming an adequate amount of vitamin C may have the following benefits.</em></p>

      <div class="headings" id="deficiency">
        <h1>Deficiency</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Deficiency, or a lack, of vitamin C in your body happens because of a lack of sufficient amounts of vitamin C in your diet. Over time, a lack of vitamin C means that new collagen cannot be formed. 
        </p>
        <p>This causes various tissues in your body to start to break down and the health and repair of your body become affected. Persistent (chronic) vitamin C deficiency, usually over a period of around three months or more, can lead to an illness known as scurvy.</p>
        <p>Scurvy due to vitamin C deficiency is rare.</p>
        <p>The most common risk factors for vitamin C deficiency are poor diet, alcoholism, anorexia, severe mental illness, smoking and dialysis. </p>
        <p>There are certain groups of people who are more at risk of vitamin C deficiency. </p>
        <p>Vitamin C cannot be made by the human body and so is an essential component of the diet. It is needed for the health and repair of various tissues in your body, including skin, bone, teeth and cartilage. </p>
        
        <p>The following are common signs of a deficiency: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Tiredness and weakness</li>
            <li>Muscle and joint pains</li>
            <li>Easy bruising</li>
            <li>Spots that look like tiny, red-blue bruises on your skin</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Persistent lack of vitamin C in your diet can lead to a condition called scurvy. Symptoms of scurvy include easy bruising, easy bleeding and joint and muscle pains. Vitamin C deficiency can be treated with supplements of vitamin C and a diet rich in vitamin C.</p>

      <div class="headings" id="toxicity-dosage">
        <h1>Toxicity and Dosage</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The average adult woman requires 70mg of vitamin C a day. The average man requires 90mg. Recommended amounts are higher for pregnant and nursing women.</p>
        <p>It’s important to discuss your individual nutritional needs with your doctor. The maximum recommended amount, or upper limit, is 2,000mg per day for all adults.</p>
        
        <p>Taking more than the upper limit for vitamin C isn’t life-threatening, but you may experience side effects like: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Diarrhea</li>
            <li>Nausea</li>
            <li>Stomach Cramping</li>
            <li>Bloating</li>
            <li>General abdominal discomfort</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The body does not absorb all of the vitamin C that it gets from supplements.</p>
        <p>People with hemochromatosis are in danger of a vitamin C overdose. This condition causes your body to store excessive amounts of iron, which is exacerbated by taking too much vitamin C. This condition can lead to body tissue damage. </p>
        <p>Vitamin C supplements may also interact with certain medications. This is especially true of medications for heart disease and cancer. Be sure to check with your doctor before taking a supplement.  </p>    
        <p>The most common side effect of high vitamin C intake is digestive distress and diarrhea and nausea.</p>
        <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

        <p>It’s well known for being a potent antioxidant, as well as having positive effects on skin health and immune function.</p>
