        <h1>What are minerals? </h1>
        <hr>

        <p>Similarly to <a class="hyperlink" href="vitamin.html">vitamins</a> , minerals are essential to human health and can be obtained in our diet from different types of food. Minerals are abundant in our everyday lives. From the soil in your front yard to the jewelry you wear on your body, we interact with minerals constantly. There are 20 essential minerals that must be consumed in our diets to remain healthy. The amount of each mineral found in our bodies vary greatly and therefore, so does consumption of those minerals. When there is a deficiency in an essential mineral, health problems may arise.</p>

        
        <p><strong><em> There are currently 16 recognized minerals.</em> </strong></p>


        <h1 class="headings" > Major minerals</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>Major minerals are classified as minerals that are required in the diet each day in amounts larger than 100 milligrams. These include sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and sulfur. These major minerals can be found in various foods. For example, in Guam, the major mineral, calcium, is consumed in the diet not only through dairy, a common source of calcium, but also through through the mixed dishes, desserts and vegetables that they consume.</p>

        <h3>The type of major minerals are:</h3>

              <hr>
              <p>Potassium plays a crucial role in maintaining fluid balance, muscle contraction and nerve impulse conduction. It supports brain health and reduces the risk of stroke. Low potassium causes irregular heartbeats, edema (swelling), brain damage, etc. </p>
              <p>Bananas, sweet potatoes, avocados, beets and dates are rich sources of potassium.</p>

              <hr>
              <p>Sodium is vital not only for maintaining fluid balance but also for many other essential functions. In contrast to many minerals, sodium absorption in the small intestine is extremely efficient and in a healthy individual all excess sodium is excreted by the kidneys. </p>
              <p> In fact, very little sodium is required in the diet (about 200 milligrams) because the kidneys actively reabsorb sodium.</p>

It is also necessary for muscle contractions, including the proper functioning of the heart, builds strong bones and teeth and helps in muscle contraction, blood clotting, nerve transmission, cell signaling and regulation of metabolism. </p>
                <p> Milk and dairy products, cashew, dates, broccoli, parsley and greens are good sources of dietary calcium. </p>

Phosphorus deficiency leads to bone diseases and growth restriction in children. Meats, poultry, beans, nuts, seeds and dairy products are rich sources of phosphorus. </p>

Magnesium is not an integral part of the hard mineral crystals, but it does reside on the surface of the crystal and helps maximize bone structure. </p>

                    <p> Chloride is the primary anion in extracellular fluid. In addition to passively following sodium, chloride has its own protein channels that reside in cell membranes. </p>

        <p>Trace minerals, also called micro minerals, are essential minerals that the human body must get from food, but, unlike macro minerals, we only need a very small amount. Even though trace minerals are needed in tiny doses, they are still crucial to our health and development. The recommended daily allowance for most trace minerals is between .2 and 15 milligrams. Find below a list of trace minerals, their functions, and common foods that contain them.</p>
