        <h1>Fluoride</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>The main function of fluoride in the body is in the mineralisation of bones and teeth. Fluoride also protects the teeth from dental caries (tooth decay) and is now routinely added to most toothpastes.</p>
        <p>In rare cases, very large amounts of (non-dietary) fluoride can cause fluorosis. Symptoms may be mild such as mottling and crumbling of the teeth, or more severe causing skeletal changes such as calcification of ligaments and tendons which leads to muscle, joint and bone problems.</p>
        <p>Fluoride is found in fluoridated water, tea and fish. The diet provides only about 25% of total intake. The addition of fluoride to toothpaste is important in those areas where the water supply is low in fluoride.</p>
        <p>Fluoride is commonly used in dentistry to strengthen enamel, which is the outer layer of your teeth. Fluoride helps to prevent cavities. This process is called water fluoridation.</p>

      <div class="headings" id="benefits">
        <h1>Health Benefits</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Fluoride is beneficial to teeth because it helps to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> rebuild (remineralize) weakened tooth enamel</li>
        <li> slow down the loss of minerals from tooth enamel</li>
        <li> reverse early signs of tooth decay</li>
        <li> prevent the growth of harmful oral bacteria</li>
    </ul>
        
        <p> When bacteria in your mouth break down sugar and carbs, they produce acids that eat away at the minerals in your tooth enamel. This loss of minerals is called demineralization. Weakened tooth enamel leaves your teeth vulnerable to bacteria that cause cavities.</p>

        <p> Fluoride helps to remineralize your tooth enamel, which can prevent cavities and reverse early signs of tooth decay.  </p>  
           <em> Consuming an adequate amount of fluoride may have the following benefits.</em></p>

      <div class="headings" id="deficiency">
        <h1>Deficiency</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Fluoride deficiency can lead to tooth decay and possibly osteoporosis. Consuming enough fluoride can make tooth decay less likely and may strengthen bones.</p> 
            <p> The addition of fluoride (fluoridation) to drinking water that is low in fluoride or the use of fluoride supplements significantly reduces the risk of tooth decay. </p>
            <p> Fluoride applied to teeth (fluoride varnish) may be helpful to reduce early childhood tooth decay in areas of the world where fluoride toothpaste or fluoridation is not readily available.</p>

      <div class="headings" id="toxicity-dosage">
        <h1>Toxicity and Dosage</h1>
        <hr>

        <p> Excess intake of fluoride for long periods of time can cause fluorosis.</p>

        <p> Two main types exist: dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis.</p>

        <p><strong> Dental Fluorosis</strong></p>

        <p> Dental fluorosis is characterized by visual changes in the appearance of teeth.</p>

        <p> In mild forms, the changes appear as white spots on teeth and are mostly a cosmetic problem. More severe cases are less common, but are associated with brown stains and weakened teeth.</p>

        <p> Dental fluorosis only occurs during the formation of teeth in childhood, but the most critical time is under the age of two.</p>

        <p> Children consuming too much fluoride from multiple sources over a period of time have a higher risk of dental fluorosis.</p>

        <p> For example, they may swallow fluoridated toothpaste in large amounts and consume too much fluoride in supplement form, in addition to ingesting fluoridated water.</p>

        <p> Infants who get their nutrition mostly from formulas mixed with fluoridated water may also have an increased risk of developing mild dental fluorosis.</p>

        <p><strong> Skeletal Fluorosis</strong></p>

        <p> Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease that involves the accumulation of fluoride in the bone over many years.</p>

        <p> Early on, symptoms include stiffness and joint pain. Advanced cases may eventually cause altered bone structure and calcification of ligaments.</p>

        <p> Skeletal fluorosis is particularly common in countries like India and China.</p>

        <p> There, it’s primarily associated with the prolonged consumption of groundwater with high levels of naturally occurring fluoride, or more than 8 ppm.</p>

        <p> Additional ways people in these areas ingest fluoride include burning coal in the home and consuming a particular type of tea called brick tea.</p>

        <p> Note that skeletal fluorosis is not an issue in regions that add fluoride to water for cavity prevention, since this amount is tightly controlled.</p>

        <p> Skeletal fluorosis only happens when people are exposed to very large amounts of fluoride for long periods of time.</p>

        <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

        <h1>Sources</h1>
        <hr>

        <p> Fluoride can be ingested or applied topically to your teeth.</p>

        <p> Here are some of the major sources of fluoride:</p>

        <ul>
        <li> <strong> Fluoridated water:</strong> Countries add fluoride to their public water supplies. Fluoridated water generally contains 0.7 parts per million (ppm).</li>

        <li> <strong> Groundwater:</strong> Groundwater naturally contains fluoride, but the concentration varies. Typically, it’s between 0.01 to 0.3 ppm, but in some areas dangerously high levels are present. This may cause serious health problems.</li>

        <li> <strong> Fluoride supplements:</strong> These are available as drops or tablets. Fluoride supplements are recommended for children over 6 months of age who have a high risk of developing cavities and live in non-fluoridated areas.</li>

        <li> <strong> Some foods:</strong> Certain foods may be processed using fluoridated water or may absorb fluoride from the soil. Tea leaves, especially old ones, may contain fluoride in higher amounts than other foods.</li>

        <li> <strong> Dental care products:</strong> Fluoride is added to a number of dental care products on the market, such as toothpaste and mouth rinses.</li>
    </ul>
        
        <p><em> A diet rich in fluoride is an essential step toward good health and disease prevention. </em></p>
</div>


       
        <div class="content-image">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="images/fluoride/image 5.jpg" alt="image 5" />

        <div class="headings" id="self-health-care-line">
        <h1>Self Health Care Line</h1>
        <hr>

        <p> Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral used in many dental products to strengthen tooth enamel and prevent cavities. It’s also added to the local water supplies in many cities.</p>

        <p> While the amount added to drinking water is considered to be relatively safe, exposure to high levels of fluoride may be linked to several health issues.</p>

        <p> If you’re concerned about your fluoride intake, ask your local government about the fluoride in your city’s water. You can also opt for fluoride-free dental products, especially if you have young children.</p>
          <p><em> A healthy, well-balanced diet is a great way to provide your body with a safe amount of this essential nutrient.</em></p>
