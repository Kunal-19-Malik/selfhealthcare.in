        <h1>Vitamin D (Calciferol)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Vitamin D is sometimes called the “sunshine vitamin” because it’s produced in your skin in response to sunlight. It’s a fat-soluble vitamin in a family of compounds that includes vitamins D-1, D-2, and D-3.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vitamin D is the only nutrient your body produces when exposed to sunlight.
        </p>
        <p>Vitamin D (also referred to as “calciferol”) is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in a few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis.</p>
        <p>
            Your body produces vitamin D naturally when it’s directly exposed to sunlight. You can also get it through certain foods and supplements to ensure adequate levels of the vitamin in your blood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vitamin D is essential for several reasons, including maintaining healthy bones and teeth. It may also protect against a range of diseases and conditions, such as type 1 diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite its name, vitamin D is not a vitamin, but a prohormone, or precursor of a hormone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vitamins are nutrients that the body cannot create, and so a person must consume them in the diet. However, the body can produce vitamin D.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vitamin D is essential for strong bones, because it helps the body use calcium from the diet. Traditionally, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with rickets, a disease in which the bone tissue doesn't properly mineralize, leading to soft bones and skeletal deformities. But increasingly, research is revealing the importance of vitamin D in protecting against a host of health problems.

        <h1>Benefits</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Vitamin D has multiple roles in the body.
        </p>
        <p>Vitamin D is one of many vitamins our bodies need to stay healthy. </p>
        <p>
            This vitamin has many functions, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong> Keeping bones strong:</strong> Having healthy bones protects you from various conditions, including rickets. Rickets is a disorder that causes children to have bones that are weak and soft. It is caused by a lack of vitamin D in the body. You need vitamin D so that calcium and phosphorus can be used to build bones. In adults, having soft bones is a condition called osteomalacia.</li>
            <li><strong> Absorbing calcium:</strong> Vitamin D, along with calcium, helps build bones and keep bones strong and healthy. Weak bones can lead to osteoporosis, the loss of bone density, which can lead to fractures. Vitamin D, once either taken orally or from sunshine exposure is then converted to an active form of the vitamin. It is that active form that promotes optimal absorption of calcium from your diet.</li>
            <li><strong> Working with parathyroid glands:</strong> The parathyroid glands work minute to minute to balance the calcium in the blood by communicating with the kidneys, gut and skeleton. When there is sufficient calcium in the diet and sufficient active Vitamin D, dietary calcium is absorbed and put to good use throughout the body. If calcium intake is insufficient, or vitamin D is low, the parathyroid glands will ‘borrow’ calcium from the skeleton in order to keep the blood calcium in the normal range.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some other benefits of Vitamin D are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Promoting healthy bones and teeth</li>
            <li>Supporting immune, brain, and nervous system health</li>
            <li>Regulating insulin levels and supporting diabetes management</li>
            <li>Supporting lung function and cardiovascular health</li>
            <li>Influencing the expression of genes involved in cancer development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
           <em> Consuming an adequate amount of vitamin D may have the following benefits.</em></p>

      <div class="headings" id="deficiency">
        <h1>Deficiency</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Although the body can create vitamin D, a deficiency can occur for many reasons.
        </p>
        <p>Vitamin D deficiency means that you do not have enough vitamin D in your body. Vitamin D is unique because your skin actually produces it by using sunlight. Fair-skinned individuals and those who are younger convert sunshine into vitamin D far better than those who are darker-skinned and over age 50. </p>

        <h3>Causes</h3>

        <p><strong> Skin type:</strong> Darker skin, for example, and sunscreen, reduce the body’s ability to absorb the ultraviolet radiation B (UVB) rays from the sun. Absorbing sunlight is essential for the skin to produce vitamin D.</p>
        <p><strong> Sunscreen:</strong> A sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 can reduce the body’s ability to synthesize the vitamin by 95%. Covering the skin with clothing can inhibit vitamin D production also.</p>
        <p><strong> Geographical location:</strong> People who live in northern latitudes or areas of high pollution, work night shifts, or are homebound should aim to consume vitamin D from food sources whenever possible.  </p>
        <p><strong> Obesity:</strong> A body mass index greater than 30 is associated with lower vitamin D levels. Fat cells keep vitamin D isolated so that it is not released. Vitamin D deficiency is more likely in obese people. Obesity often makes it necessary to take larger doses of vitamin D supplements in order to reach and maintain normal D levels.</p>

        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <p>Getting enough vitamin D may also play a role in helping to keep you healthy by protecting against the following conditions and possibly helping to treat them.</p>

        <p>These conditions can include:</p>

        
        <ul>
            <li>Regular sickness or infection</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>Bone and back pain</li>
            <li>Low mood</li>
            <li>Impaired wound healing</li>
            <li>Hair loss</li>
            <li>Muscle pain</li>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If Vitamin D deficiency continues for long periods, it may result in complications such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cardiovascular conditions</li>
            <li>Autoimmune problems</li>
            <li>Neurological diseases</li>
            <li>Infections</li>
            <li>Pregnancy complications</li>
            <li>Certain cancers, especially breast, prostate, and colon.</li>

      <div class="headings" id="toxicity-dosage">
        <h1>Toxicity and Dosage</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Vitamin D toxicity is extremely rare, but does occur with extreme doses. </p>
        <p>It usually develops over time, since extra vitamin D can build up in the body. </p>
        <p>Nearly all vitamin D overdoses result from taking high amounts of vitamin D supplements. </p>
        <p>Since relatively little is known about how vitamin D toxicity works, it is hard to define an exact threshold for safe or toxic vitamin D intake.</p>
        <p>According to the Institute of Medicine, 4000 IU is the safe upper level of daily vitamin D intake. However, doses up to 10,000 IU have not been shown to cause toxicity in healthy individuals.</p>
        <p>Vitamin D toxicity is generally caused by excessive doses of vitamin D supplements, not by diet or sun exposure. </p>    
        <p>A daily intake ranging from 40,000–100,000 IU (1000–2500 micrograms), for one to several months, has been shown to cause toxicity in humans.</p>
        
        <p>Signs of toxicity include the following:</p>   
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of appetite</li>
            <li>Dry mouth</li>
            <li>A metallic taste</li>
            <li>Vomiting</li>
            <li>Constipation</li>
            <li>Diarrhea</li>
        </ul>          
        <p>In healthy people, the amount of vitamin D needed per day varies by age. </p>
        <p>Excess vitamin D usually occurs from taking too many supplements. It is best to get vitamin D from natural sources. </p>
        <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

        <h1>Sources</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>You can get vitamin D in a variety of ways.</p>
        <p>Getting sufficient sunlight is the best way to help the body produce enough vitamin D.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Being exposed to the sun. About 15-20 minutes three days per week is usually sufficient.</li>
            <li>Through the foods you eat.</li>
            <li>Through nutritional supplements.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Plentiful food sources of vitamin D include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, and tuna</li>
            <li>Egg Yolks</li>
            <li>Beef Liver</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Fortified Milk</li>
            <li>Foryified cereals and juices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What does sunlight have to do with getting enough vitamin D?</h3>
        <p>There are health benefits of sunlight. Vitamin D is produced when your skin is exposed to sunshine, or rather, the ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation that the sun emits.</p> 
        <p>The amount of vitamin D that your skin makes depends on such factors as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong> The season:</strong> This factor depends a bit on where you live. In areas such as Cleveland, OH, the UV-B light does not reach the earth for six months out of the year due to the ozone layer and the zenith of the sun.</li>
            <li><strong> The time of day:</strong> The sun's rays are most powerful between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.</li>
            <li><strong> Where you live:</strong> Cities near the equator have higher ultraviolet (UV) light levels. It is the UV-B light in sunlight that causes your skin to make vitamin D.</li>
            <li><strong> The melanin content of your skin:</strong> Melanin is a brown-black pigment in the eyes, hair and skin. Melanin causes skin to tan. The darker your skin, the more sun exposure is needed in order to get sufficient vitamin D from the sun.</li>
            <li>The amount of cloud cover and air pollution.</li>
        </ul>
