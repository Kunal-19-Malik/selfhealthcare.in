        <h1>Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Vitamin B2, or riboflavin, is one of eight B vitamins that are essential for human health. It can be found in grains, plants, and dairy products. It is crucial for breaking down food components, absorbing other nutrients, and maintaining tissues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vitamin B2 is a water-soluble vitamin, so it dissolves in water. All vitamins are either water soluble or fat soluble. Water-soluble vitamins are carried through the bloodstream, and whatever is not needed passes out of the body in urine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vitamin B2, or riboflavin, is naturally present in foods, added to foods, and available as a supplement. Bacteria in the gut can produce small amounts of riboflavin, but not enough to meet dietary needs. Riboflavin is a key component of coenzymes involved with the growth of cells, energy production, and the breakdown of fats, steroids, and medications. 
        </p>
        <p> People need to consume vitamin B2 every day, because the body can only store small amounts, and supplies go down rapidly.
        </p>
        <p>Most riboflavin is used immediately and not stored in the body, so excess amounts are excreted in the urine. An excess of dietary riboflavin, usually from supplements, can cause urine to become bright yellow.</p>
        <p>Riboflavin occurs naturally in some foods, added to others, and it can be taken as supplements. Most of it is absorbed Trusted Source in the small intestine.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It is involved in many processes in the body and is necessary for normal cell growth and function. It can be found in certain foods such as milk, meat, eggs, nuts, enriched flour, and green vegetables. Riboflavin is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex products.

        </p>
        
        <p>
            Some people also take riboflavin by mouth to maintain healthy hair, skin, and nails, to slow aging, for canker sores, multiple sclerosis, memory loss including Alzheimer's disease, high blood pressure, burns, liver disease, and sickle cell anemia.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is usually present in plant and dairy products and has to be consumed regularly as being a water-soluble nutrient, the body does not store much of it. Vitamin B2 is frequently used along with other forms of vitamin B. It plays a key role in the development and bodily functions including the brain, blood cells, skin and lining of the digestive tract. 
        </p>
        <p>Vitamin B2 got named as riboflavin owing to its natural colour as the term, ‘flavin’ in riboflavin comes from ‘flavus’, the Latin word for yellow. Unlike any other vitamin, one can usually understand the amount of vitamin B2 reserved in the body by seeing the colour of urine since it naturally turns bright yellow.

        <h1> Benefits</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Vitamin B2 or riboflavin plays an integral part in the conversion of energy for various bodily activities. It also takes part in the conversion of the various other B vitamins into forms which is acceptable by the body.</p>
        <p>The B2 vitamin is also essential for the electron transport chain that produces cellular energy and in turn, facilitates the processing of amino acids and fats. It can also serve as an antioxidant, which slows the pace of aging.</p>
        <p>Vitamin B2 helps break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. It plays a vital role in maintaining the body’s energy supply. 
        </p>
        <p>Riboflavin helps convert carbohydrates into adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The human body produces ATP from food, and ATP produces energy as the body requires it. The compound ATP is vital for storing energy in muscles.</p>
        <p>
            Because riboflavin assists many enzymes with various daily functions throughout the body, a deficiency can lead to health problems. Animal studies show that the brain and heart disorders and some cancers can develop from long-term riboflavin deficiency. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This vitamin has many functions, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining the mucous membranes in the digestive system
            </li>
            <li>Maintaining a healthy liver</li>
            <li>Helps in migraine problems</li>
            <li>Converting tryptophan into niacin, an amino acid</li>
            <li>Keeping the eyes, nerves, muscles and skin healthy</li>
            <li>Cerebellar syndrome, a type of brain damage</li>
            <li>Absorbing and activating iron, folic acid, and vitamins B1, B3 and B6</li>
            <li>Hormone production by the adrenal glands</li>
            <li>Preventing the development of cataracts</li>
            <li>Fetal development, especially in areas where vitamin deficiency is common</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Some research suggests that vitamin B2 may help prevent cataracts and migraine headache.</p>
            <p>Other studies have found that in children with autism, supplements of vitamins B2, B6, and magnesium appear to reduce the levels of abnormal organic acids in the urine.</p>

          <p> <em> Consuming an adequate amount of vitamin B2 may have the following benefits.</em></p>

      <div class="headings" id="deficiency">
        <h1>Deficiency</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Vitamin B2 deficiency is a significant risk when diet is poor, because the human body excretes the vitamin continuously, so it is not stored. A person who has a B2 deficiency normally lacks other vitamins too. 
        </p>
        <p>This vitamin is essential for providing energy to the body for carrying various activities. Lack of it can decrease the metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates leading to underlying deficiency syndromes.</p>

        <p>Riboflavin deficiency also termed as ariboflavinosis causes stomatitis including painful red tongue with sore throat, red chapped, and fissured lips (also called cheilosis), and inflammation of the corners of the mouth (i.e. angular stomatitis), inflammation of the tongue, mouth ulcers and cracks at the corner of the mouth (i.e. angular cheilitis). </p>

        <p>Disorders of the thyroid can increase the risk of a deficiency. A riboflavin deficiency most often occurs with other nutrient deficiencies, such as in those who are malnourished.</p>

        <p>Generally, a diet lacking this potent nutrient may cause bloodshot eyes, high sensitivity to light, a burning sensation in the eyes or itchy, watery eyes, split nails, dry or oily hair, dandruff, indigestion, dizziness, insomnia, etc.</p>

        <p>There are two types of riboflavin deficiency: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Primary riboflavin deficiency happens when the person’s diet is poor in vitamin B2.</li>
            <li>Secondary riboflavin deficiency happens for another reason, maybe because the intestines cannot absorb the vitamin properly, or the body cannot use it, or because it is being excreted too rapidly.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Riboflavin deficiency is also known as ariboflavinosis.</p>
        
        <p>The following are common signs of a deficiency: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Angular cheilitis, or cracks at the corners of the mouth</li>
            <li>Cracked lips</li>
            <li>Dry skin</li>
            <li>Inflammation of the lining of the mouth</li>
            <li>Inflammation of the tongue</li>
            <li>Mouth ulcers</li>
            <li>Red lips</li>
            <li>Sore throat</li>
            <li>Scrotal dermatitis</li>
            <li>Fluid in mucous membranes</li>
            <li>Iron deficiency - anemia</li>
            <li>Eyes may be sensitive to bright light, and they may be itchy, watery, or bloodshot</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A diet deficient in this B vitamin for a pregnant woman can also cause birth defects, congenital cardiac defects and abnormal limbs and deformities in the foetus. It can also lead to pellagra or malaria in adults. If the symptoms of riboflavin deficiencies are not met with for a long time period, it may also lead to degeneration of the liver and neural system.</p>

        <p>People who drink excessive amounts of alcohol are at greater risk of vitamin B deficiency.</p>

      <div class="headings" id="toxicity-dosage">
        <h1>Toxicity and Dosage</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Vitamin B2 is one such essential nutrient that does not portray any abnormal side effects or contraindications if taken in an optimum amount. A diet rich in riboflavin mostly turns the colour of urine yellowish-orange. </p>

        <p>The Food and Nutrition Board for the National Institute of Medicine vouches for the safety of this vitamin in children as well after proper consultation with a nutritionist. </p>
        <p>The Recommended Daily Allowance of the B vitamin is 1.3 mg daily for men and 1.1 mg for women.</p>
        <p> It is extremely important to get consulted with a doctor or health supervisor before taking Vitamin B2 in supplement form as an overdosage might cause migraine, cataract, stomach pain, and diarrhoea. </p>

        <p>A toxic level of riboflavin has not been observed from food sources and supplements. The gut can only absorb a limited amount of riboflavin at one time, and an excess is quickly excreted in the urine. Therefore, a Tolerable Upper Intake Level for riboflavin has not been established.</p>
        
        <p>Riboflavin is generally considered safe, even at high doses. Riboflavin does not seem to cause any serious side effects. Very high doses may cause: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Itching</li>
            <li>Numbness</li>
            <li>Burning or prickling sensations</li>
            <li>Yellow or orange urine</li>
            <li>Sensitivity to light</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The primary risk of excess B-2 is damage to the liver. However, excess riboflavin, or riboflavin toxicity, is rare. You’d have to eat almost impossibly large quantities of food to overdose on riboflavin naturally. You could get too much vitamin B-2 through supplements in oral or injection form, but this is also rare because your body doesn’t store the vitamin.</p>

        <p>Taking any one of the B vitamins for a long period of time can result in an imbalance of other important B vitamins. For this reason, you may want to take a B-complex vitamin which includes all the B vitamins.</p>
        <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

        <h1>Sources</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Eat a healthy and balanced diet to get enough vitamin B-2. It’s present at the levels most people need in dairy products, including cottage cheese and milk.</p>
        <p>It’s sensitive to light and perishable, however. Grain products may not have much naturally occurring riboflavin by the time they get to your table. This is why it’s sometimes added in processing.</p>
        <p>Riboflavin is often a supplement in cereal and bread, and it can be present as food coloring in candy. If you’ve ever consumed a lot of B vitamins, you might have noticed a dark yellow tinge to your urine. This color comes from the riboflavin.</p>

        <p>Here are some food sources of vitamin B2:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Egg Yolks</li>

        <p>Vitamin B2 is water soluble, so cooking foods can cause it to be lost. About twice as much B2 is lost through boiling as it is through steaming or microwaving. </p>

        <p>Breads and cereals are often fortified with riboflavin. Fortified means the vitamin has been added to the food.</p>

        <p>Riboflavin is destroyed by exposure to light. Foods with riboflavin should not be stored in clear containers that are exposed to light.</p>

        <p><em> A diet rich in vitamin B2 is an essential step toward good health and disease prevention. </em></p>
