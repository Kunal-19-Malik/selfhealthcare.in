        <h1>Iron</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Iron is a mineral vital to the proper function of hemoglobin, a protein needed to transport oxygen in the blood. Iron also has a role in a variety of other important processes in the body. 
        </p>
        <p>Iron is a mineral found in every cell of the body. Iron is considered an essential mineral because it is needed to make hemoglobin, a part of blood cells.</p>

            <p> The human body needs iron to make the oxygen-carrying proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin. Hemoglobin is found in red blood cells. Myoglobin is found in muscles.</p>
            
            <p>Iron also helps remove carbon dioxide. When the body's iron stores become so low that not enough normal red blood cells can be made to carry oxygen efficiently, a condition known as iron deficiency anemia develops.</p>

            <p>When levels of iron are low, fatigue, weakness and difficulty maintaining body temperature often result.</p>

            <p>Even though iron is widely available in food, some people, like adolescent girls and women ages 19 to 50 years old may not get the amount they need on a daily basis. It is also a concern for young children and women who are pregnant or capable of becoming pregnant. If treatment for iron deficiency is needed, a health-care provider will assess iron status and determine the exact form of treatment — which may include changes in diet and/or taking supplements.</p>

            <p>Babies need iron for brain development and growth. They store enough iron for the first four to six months of life. A supplement may be recommended by a pediatrician for a baby that is premature or a low-birth weight and breastfed. After six months, their need for iron increases, so the introduction of solid foods when the baby is developmentally ready can help to provide sources of iron. Most infant formulas are fortified with iron.</p>

        <h1>Health Benefits</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Iron is stored in the body as ferritin (in the liver, spleen, muscle tissue, and bone marrow) and is delivered throughout the body by transferrin (a protein in blood that binds to iron).</p>

        <p> Iron helps to preserve many vital functions in the body, including general energy and focus, gastrointestinal processes, the immune system, and the regulation of body temperature.</p>

        <p>    
        The benefits of iron often go unnoticed until a person is not getting enough. Iron deficiency anemia can cause fatigue, heart palpitations, pale skin, and breathlessness.
        </p>

        <p>Some of the benefits are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong> Healthy Pragnancy</strong> <p> Blood volume and red blood cell production increase dramatically during pregnancy to supply the growing fetus with oxygen and nutrients. As a result, the demand for iron also increases. While the body typically maximizes iron absorption during pregnancy, insufficient iron intake or other factors affecting the way iron is absorbed can lead to iron deficiency.</p>

                <p> Low iron intake during pregnancy increases the risk of premature birth and low birth weight, as well as low iron stores and impaired cognitive or behavioral development in infants. Pregnant women with low iron may be more prone to infection because iron also supports the immune system.</p>
                
                <p> It is clear that iron supplements are needed for women who are both pregnant and iron-deficient. However, research is ongoing as to the possibility of recommending additional iron to all pregnant women, even those with normal iron levels. It is argued that all pregnant women should take 30 to 60 milligrams (mg) of iron supplements on every day of their pregnancy, regardless of their iron levels.</p></li>
            <li><strong> Energy</strong>
                <p> Insufficient iron in the diet can affect the efficiency with which the body uses energy. Iron carries oxygen to the muscles and brain and is crucial for both mental and physical performance. Low iron levels may result in a lack of focus, increased irritability, and reduced stamina.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong> Better athletic performance</strong>
                <p> Iron deficiency is more common among athletes, especially young female athletes, than in individuals who do not lead an active lifestyle.</p>
                
                <p> This appears to be particularly true in female endurance athletes, such as long-distance runners. Some experts suggest that female endurance athletes should add an additional 10 mgTrusted Source of elemental iron per day to the current RDA for iron intake.</p>
                
                <p> Iron deficiency in athletes decreases athletic performance and weakens immune system activity. A lack of hemoglobin can greatly reduce performance during physical exertion, as it decreases the body’s ability to transport oxygen to the muscles.</p></li>
        </ul>

      <div class="headings" id="deficiency">
        <h1>Deficiency</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> An iron deficiency is seen most commonly in children, women who are menstruating or pregnant, and those eating a diet lacking in iron.</p>

<p> Iron deficiency occurs in stages. The mild form begins with a decrease in stored iron, usually either from a low-iron diet or from excessive bleeding. If this does not resolve, the next stage is a greater depletion of iron stores and a drop in red blood cells.</p> 
<p> Eventually this leads to iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) where iron stores are used up and there is significant loss of total red blood cells. Typically, a doctor screens for anemia by first checking a complete blood count (including hemoglobin, hematocrit, and other factors that measure red blood cell volume and size).</p> 
<p> If this is below normal, ferritin and transferrin levels may be measured to determine if the type of anemia is IDA (there are other forms of anemia not caused specifically by an iron deficiency). All of these measures would decrease with IDA.</p>

<p>Signs of IDA:</p>

<ul>
    
<li> Fatigue, weakness</li>
<li> Lightheadedness</li>
<li> Confusion, loss of concentration</li>
<li> Sensitivity to cold</li>
<li> Shortness of breath</li>
<li> Rapid heartbeat</li>
<li> Pale skin</li>
<li> Hair loss, brittle nails</li>
<li> Pica: cravings for dirt, clay, ice, or other non-food items</li>
</ul>
<p> IDA is usually corrected with oral iron supplements of up to 150-200 mg of elemental iron daily. Those at high risk of IDA may be prescribed 60-100 mg daily. Blood levels should be rechecked periodically, and supplements discontinued or taken at a lower dosage if levels return to normal, as long-term high dosages can lead to constipation or other digestive upset.</p>

<p>Groups at risk for IDA:</p>    

<ul>
<li><strong>Pregnant women</strong><p> During pregnancy a woman produces much greater amounts of red blood cells for the fetus, increasing the need for additional dietary or supplemental iron.</p> <p> IDA during pregnancy can lead to premature birth or low birth weight so iron is routinely included in prenatal vitamins. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that all pregnant women begin taking 30 mg daily of supplemental iron.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong> Menstruating women</strong>
        <p> Women who experience heavy bleeding during menstruation (lasting longer than 7 days or soaking through tampons or pads once every hour) can develop IDA.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Children</strong><p> Infants and children have high iron needs due to their rapid growth.</p></li>
    
    <li><strong>Elderly</strong><p> Older ages are associated with a higher risk of poor nutrition and chronic inflammatory diseases that can lead to anemia.</p>
    </li>
            <li><strong>Vegetarians</strong><p> Those who eat a diet without heme iron from meats, fish, and poultry may develop IDA if they do not include adequate non-heme iron foods in the diet.</p> <p> Because non-heme iron is not well-absorbed, either greater quantities of these foods my be required or careful attention is needed in how they are eaten to improve absorption (consuming with vitamin C-rich foods while avoiding eating with calcium-rich foods, calcium supplements, or tea).
            </p>
            </li>
        <li><strong>Endurance athletes</strong>
            <p> Running can cause trace amounts of gastrointestinal bleeding and a condition called “foot-strike” hemolysis that breaks down red blood cells at a faster rate. Female endurance athletes who are also menstruating are at greatest risk for IDA.</p>
            <p> People with chronic kidney failure on dialysis—the kidneys make a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) that signals the body to make red blood cells. Kidney failure reduces the production of EPO and therefore blood cells. In addition, there is some blood loss during hemodialysis.</p>

      <div class="headings" id="toxicity-dosage">
        <h1>Toxicity and Dosage</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Toxicity is rare because the body regulates iron absorption and will absorb less if iron stores are adequate. Excessive iron occurs most often from taking high-dosage supplements when not needed or from having a genetic condition that stores too much iron.</p>

        <p>In adults, doses for oral iron supplementation can be as high as 60 to 120 mg of elemental iron per day. </p>

        <p> Common signs:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Constipation</li>
        <li> Upset stomach</li>
        <li> Nausea, vomiting</li>
        <li> Abdominal pain</li>
    </ul>
        <p> Some people have a hereditary condition called hemochromatosis that causes an excessive buildup of iron in the body. Treatments are given periodically to remove blood or excess iron in the blood. People with hemochromatosis are educated to follow a low-iron diet and to avoid iron and vitamin C supplements.</p>
         <p> If left untreated, iron can build up in certain organs so that there is a higher risk of developing conditions like liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, or heart disease.</p>

        <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

      <div class="headings" id="sources">
        <h1>Sources</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Iron has a low bioavailability, meaning that the small intestine does not readily absorb large amounts. This decreases its availability for use and increases the likelihood of deficiency.</p>

        <p> Meats, poultry, and seafood are richest in heme iron.</p>     
        <p> Fortified grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and vegetables contain non-heme iron.</p>

        <p> Heme iron is better absorbed by the body than non-heme iron. Certain factors can improve or inhibit the absorption of non-heme iron. Vitamin C and heme iron taken at the same meal can improve the absorption of non-heme iron. Bran fiber, large amounts of calcium particularly from supplements, and plant substances like phytates and tannins can inhibit the absorption of non-heme iron. 
            
            <p> Sources of heme iron:</p>
            <ul>
<li> Oysters, clams, mussels</li>
<li> Beef or chicken liver</li>
<li> Organ meats</li>
<li> Canned sardines</li>
<li> Beef</li>
<li> Poultry</li>
<li> Canned light tuna</li>
</ul>
<p> Sources of non-heme iron: </p>
<ul>
<li> Fortified breakfast cereals</li>
<li> Beans</li>
<li> Dark chocolate (at least 45%)</li>
<li> Lentils</li>
<li> Spinach</li>
