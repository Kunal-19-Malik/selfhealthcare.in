                <h1>Vitamin B9 (Folic Acid)</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Vitamin B9, well-known as Folate or Folic acid in layman terms is one of the eight water-soluble vitamins. The term folate comes from the Latin word folium which means ‘leaf’ since it is chiefly found in many leafy plants and vegetables. </p>
                <p>
                    Just like most B vitamins, it is used for converting food (i.e. carbohydrates) into simpler, easy to digest forms, i.e. glucose which is necessary for energy production. Apart from energy synthesis, folic acid is extremely crucial for the proper functioning of the brain and uplifting mental and emotional health.</p>
                    <p>Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate, which is a naturally occurring B vitamin. Folate helps make DNA and other genetic material. It is especially important in prenatal health.</p>
                    <p>
                        In particular, it supports healthy cell division and promotes proper fetal growth and development to reduce the risk of birth defects. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B9 actively participates in the synthesis of DNA and RNA which is highly necessary during rapid growth periods like puberty and pregnancy. It also helps in the synthesis and conversion of nucleic acid, amino acid as well as functions as a cofactor in several enzymatic reactions. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Vitamin B9 works with vitamins B6 and B12 and other nutrients to control blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine. High levels of homocysteine are associated with heart disease, however researchers are not sure whether homocysteine is a cause of heart disease or just a marker that indicates someone may have heart disease. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B9 is found naturally in many foods, as well as in the form of folic acid in fortified foods.
                </p>

                <h1>Benefits</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B9 or folic acid is pivotal for making red blood cells, helping in rapid cell division and growth, synthesis of RNA and DNA and enhancing brain activities. It holds high significance in maintaining the growth and replication of cells and tissues during the growing years such as during pregnancy, infancy, childhood and adolescence. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is strongly advised for pregnant women to have folic acid-rich foods or supplements since it helps prevent the foetus from developing major congenital deformities of the brain or spine, including neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B9 can minimize the risk of congenital heart defects, cleft lip palate defects, and other abnormalities during the preconception period. Hence, it is even beneficial for women planning for a pregnancy to take vitamin B9 to thwart these abnormalities in the foetus. It also helps prevent sudden miscarriages.  
                </p>
                <p>Several types of research show that foods rich in vitamin B9 shows strong anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties and hence are useful for treating and reducing pain and inflammation during arthritis. </p>

                <p>Regular intake of folic acid has shown to reduce homocysteine levels in the blood, an increase of which can cause heart ailments and elevated risk of hardening of arteries i.e. atherosclerosis. Vitamin B9 intake also reported a marked reduction of heart blocks and strokes.</p>

                <p>It serves many important functions in your body. For example, it plays a crucial role in cell growth and the formation of DNA.</p>

                
                

                <p>Low levels of vitamin B9 are associated with an increased risk of several health conditions, including:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li><strong> Elevated homocysteine:</strong> High homocysteine levels have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease and stroke </li>
                 <li><strong> Birth defects:</strong> Low folate levels in pregnant women have been linked to birth abnormalities, such as neural tube defects </li>
                 <li><strong> Cancer risk:</strong> Poor levels of folate are also linked to increased cancer risk </li>
                 
                </ul>

                <p>It helps the body make healthy new red blood cells, for example. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. If the body does not make enough of these, a person can develop anemia, leading to fatigue, weakness, and a pale complexion. </p>
                <p>
                    Folate is also important for the synthesis and repair of DNA and other genetic material, and it is necessary for cells to divide.

                <h1>Deficiency</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Although quite rare in most of the developing nations, an unhealthy diet void of vegetables and folate-rich foods can lead to severe deficiency syndromes. Vitamin B9 deficiency is mostly seen in people suffering from alcohol addiction since it prevents the absorption of folate and causes an early excretion from the body. 
                </p>
                <p>It is also common in pregnant women, people suffering from digestive disorders like Celiac disease, Inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn’s disease which interferes in the absorption of folate and people suffering from gene abnormality, where their body cannot convert folate into its active form. </p>
                <p>
                    Folate deficiency occurs when there is not enough folate present in the body. This can lead to a type of anemia called megaloblastic anemia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During pregnancy, folate deficiency increases the risk of congenital irregularities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most potent deficiency syndrome that occurs due to lack of vitamin B9 is anaemia; a condition which happens when one lacks an adequate amount of red blood cells to carry oxygen to the different parts of the body. Folate deficiency may also lead to diarrhoea, depression, glossitis, confusion, and foetal neural tube, brain defects, fatigue, mouth sores, poor growth, grey hair, and swollen tongue. 
                </p>

                <p>A folate deficiency is rare because it is found in a wide range of foods. </p>

                <p>Symptoms appearing with a folate deficiency:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Weakness</li>
                  <li>Fatigue</li>
                  <li>Trouble Concentrating</li>
                  <li>Headache</li>
                  <li>Irritability</li>
                  <li>Heart Palpitations</li>
                  <li>Sores on the tongue and inside the mouth</li>
                  <li>A change in color of the skin, hair, or fingernails
                </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    It can also cause megaloblastic anaemia; a severe anaemic condition arising from a lack of folate or folic acid in the diet or poor absorption of the nutrient into the body that ultimately produces less red blood cells, which are larger in size than normal. Severe deficiency symptoms also include loss of appetite, irritable mood, weakness, fatigue, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, depression, low bone density, problems with memory and difficulty in concentrating.
                    </p>
                   
                  <p>Some groups at increased risk of folate deficiency include:</p>

                  <ul>
                      <li>People with alcohol use disorder </li>
                        <li>Pregnant women</li>
                        <li>People of childbearing age</li>
                        <li>People with MTHFR polymorphism</li>
                        <li>People with conditions that affect nutrient Absorption, including IBD and celiac disease
                        </li>
                  </ul>

                <p>Deficiency of vitamin B9 can also indicate a deficiency of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in converting vitamin B9 to its active form in the body, tetrahydrofolic acid. Deficiency can be prevented by adequate consumption of foods rich in vitamin B9 or through supplements.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Since vitamin B9 is water-soluble, it is excreted regularly from the body via urine which effectively lowers the risk of toxicity.  </p>

                <p>The Recommended Dietary Intake of folate is 400 mcg.</p>
                
                <p>
                    Pregnant women and those planning pregnancies are suggested to have 400 to 800 mcg of folate every day. But do keep in mind to get consulted with a doctor or health care personnel before taking Vitamin B9 in supplement form as an overdosage or anything more than the prescribed amount can cause side effects like sleep disturbances, mental confusion, skin reactions, loss of appetite, nausea, seizures and gastrointestinal defects.   
                </p>

                <p>An upper limit for folic acid is set at 1,000 mcg daily because studies have shown that taking higher amounts can mask a vitamin B12 deficiency. This  deficiency occurs most often in older adults or those eating a vegan diet in whom a B12 deficiency is more common. Both folate and B12 are involved in making red blood cells, and a shortage of either can result in anemia.</p>


                <p>Folic acid supplements play an important role in ensuring that vulnerable individuals and those in greater need of folate receive enough. Increasing intake of folate-rich foods is also important as these foods typically also provide plenty of other nutrients that all act together to support good health.</p>

                <p>At the recommended daily allowance, side effects from folic acid are rare. Very high doses can cause:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Stomach Problem</li>
                    <li>Sleep Problems</li>
                    <li>Skin Reactions</li>
                    <li>Confusion</li>
                    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                    <li>Nausea</li>
                    <li>Seizures</li>
                </ul>
                                
                <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

                <p>
                    Vitamin B9 holds high significance for the healthy functioning of the brain. Unlike the fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E and K, this water-soluble vitamin is produced in very minute quantity in the body, hence to suffice the dietary needs one has to strictly depend on external food sources and supplements rich in folic acid. And much to our relief, Mother Nature has blessed us with a generous amount of natural food sources laden with vitamin B9 that serves our daily requirements of this healthful nutrient.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Folic acid is present in dietary supplements and fortified foods, including breads, flours, cereals, and grains. It is also a common addition to B-complex vitamins.  
                </p>
                
                <p>Vitamin B9 has variable bioavailability depending on the form and conditions of ingestion. In the form of folic acid from supplements, vitamin B9 is also 100% bioavailable when taken without food. When taken with food, folic acid is more bioavailable in the gut than its naturally occurring folate (85% vs 50% absorption respectively).</p>

                <p>Here are some food sources of vitamin B9:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Legumes</li>
                    <li>Asparagus</li>
                    <li>Eggs</li>
                    <li>Leafy greens</li>
                    <li>Beets</li>
                    <li>Citrus Fruits</li>
                    <li>Brussels sprouts</li>
                    <li>Broccoli</li>
                    <li>Nuts and Seeds</li>
                    <li>Wheat germ</li>
                    <li>Papaya</li>
                    <li>Bananas</li>
                    <li>Avocados</li>
                    <li>Fortified grains</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Alternatives to folic acid supplements include 5-MTHT (levomefolate) or whole foods, such as leafy greens.</p>
                <p>Consuming adequate amounts of vitamin B9 is important for optimal health. </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B9 is very stable and does not gets destroyed easily, hence the food sources can be cooked and consumed.
                </p>

                    High intake of folic acid may lead to increased blood levels of unmetabolized folic acid. Some researchers speculate that this may have adverse health effects over time, but further studies are needed before solid conclusions can be reached.
