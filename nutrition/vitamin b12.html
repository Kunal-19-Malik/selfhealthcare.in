                <h1>Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Vitamin B12, chemically termed as Cobalamin is the last of the eight water-soluble vitamins that serves as a co-factor on DNA synthesis, amino acid metabolism and synthesis of fatty acids. It primarily aims towards the healthy functioning and development of the brain owing to its part in the synthesis of myelin, boosting the immune system and maturation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient that your body can’t make on its own, so you need to get it from your diet or supplements.
                </p>
                    <p>Vegetarians, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and others at risk of deficiency may want to track their diets closely to make sure they’re getting enough.</p>
                    <p>
                        It plays an essential role in the production of your red blood cells and DNA, as well as the proper functioning of your nervous system.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B12 is naturally found in animal foods, including meats, fish, poultry, eggs and dairy. However, it can also be found in products fortified with B12, such as some varieties of bread and plant-based milk.  
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Vitamin B12 is naturally produced in certain types of bacteria and archaea that normally reside in the soil surrounded by grasses that are fed upon by certain mammals like cows and sheep that come under the ruminant category. The bacteria then proliferate within their body forms a part of their gut flora, gets absorbed in their muscle masses, passes through their body and again released into the soil producing more vitamin B12. Hence, the vitamin B12 is passed on to some fermented plant products and in milk, meat or eggs obtained from animals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our body usually absorbs vitamin B12 from the food in two distinct phases. In Phase 1, the hydrochloric acid present in the stomach detaches the vitamin B12 from the food that we eat. Whereas, in Phase 2, a protein secreted in the stomach known as intrinsic factor attaches itself to the B12 vitamin and hence helps in to get absorbed by the body. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vitamin B12 is a powerful neural compound that is extremely essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters. It is also required for the proper growth, development and functioning of the brain and nerves, the formation of red blood cell, cell metabolism, and the production of DNA. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being a potent brain compound, it plays a key role in treating and preventing psychotic conditions like Alzheimer’s, memory loss and dementia. It also slows down ageing, stimulates mood, improves mental function, and bolsters the immune system. Playing the role of a co-factor, it helps in the synthesis of neurotransmitters which in turn helps to regulate mood swings, prevent depression, mental disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety, pain and fatigue.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regular intake of the B12 vitamin has shown to reduce homocysteine levels in the blood; a protein that is responsible for damaging arterial walls, an increase of which can cause heart ailments and elevated risk of hardening of arteries i.e. atherosclerosis. It also effectively reduces the risk of high triglyceride levels in the blood which causes a marked reduction of heart blocks and strokes.   
                </p>
                <p>The metabolism of every cell in the body depends on vitamin B-12, as it plays a part in the synthesis of fatty acids and energy production. Vitamin B-12 enables the release of energy by helping the human body absorb folic acid. </p>

                <p>The human body produces millions of red blood cells every minute. These cells cannot multiply properly without vitamin B-12. The production of red blood cells reduces if vitamin B-12 levels are too low. Anemia can occur if the red blood cell count drops.</p>

                <p>It serves many important functions in your body. For example, it plays a crucial role in cell growth and the formation of DNA.</p>

                <p>Cobalamin is also important for treating conditions like: </p>

                <ul>
                 <li>Diabetes</li>
                 <li>Weak Bones</li>

                </ul>

                <p>Taken in adequate quantity, vitamin B12 helps to enhance bone health, increase bone density, bone mineralization and helps in the natural growth and remodelling of bones. It also reduces the risk of fracture, strengthens the bones, maintain overall body balance and provides the body with a strong and perfect skeletal structure. </p>

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Although vitamin B12 deficiency is quite uncommon in most of the developing nations, it’s not that rare. Lack of this essential nutrient can lead to severe symptoms causing vitamin B12 or cobalamin deficiency. 
                </p>
                <p>With age, it can become harder to absorb this vitamin. It can also happen if you have had weight loss surgery or another operation that removed part of your stomach, or if you drink heavily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can result in irreversible and potentially severe damage, especially to the nervous system and brain.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even slightly lower-than-normal levels of vitamin B-12 can trigger deficiency symptoms, such as depression, confusion, memory problems, and fatigue. However, these symptoms alone are not specific enough to diagnose vitamin B-12 deficiency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vitamin B-12 deficiency carries a serious risk of permanent nerve and brain damage. Some people with insufficient vitamin B-12 have a higher risk of developing psychosis, mania, and dementia. 
                </p>

                <p>Vitamin B12 deficiency is rare because it is found in a wide range of foods. </p>

                <p>Symptoms appearing deficiency:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Weight loss</li>
                  <li>A sore mouth or tongue</li>
                  <li>pale or yellowing skin</li>
                  <li>Diarrhea</li>
                  <li>Menstrual Problem</li>

                    Vitamin B12 though extremely necessary for healthy functioning of brain and nerve cells, over intake of vitamin B12 through food sources and supplements might be fatal to the body.</p>

                <p>The Recommended Dietary Intake is 2.4 mcg for adults, 1.8mcg for older children, 2.6 mcg for pregnant women and 2.8 mcg for lactating mothers. </p>
            

                <p>Cyanocobalamin is an injectable form of the supplement that contains traces of cyanide, a poisonous substance. As a result, some concerns have been raised about its possible effects. However, many fruits and vegetables contain these traces, and it is not considered a significant health risk.</p>


                <p>This type of supplement is not, however, recommended for people with kidney disease.</p>

                <p>At the recommended daily allowance, side effects are rare. Very high doses can cause:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Dizziness</li>
                    <li>Anxiety</li>

                    The mood-control vitamin is extremely vital for the healthy functioning of the brain and body. Like any other water-soluble vitamins, this B12 vitamin also gets washed away from the body, hence one should consume a diet rich in vitamin B12 food choices to prevent the deficiency syndromes.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the stomach with the help of a protein called intrinsic factor. This substance binds to the vitamin B12 molecule and facilitates its absorption into your blood and cells.  
                </p>
                
                <p>Your body stores excess vitamin B12 in the liver, so if you consume more than the RDI, your body will save it for future use.</p>
                
                <p>You may develop a vitamin B12 deficiency if your body does not produce enough intrinsic factor, or if you don’t eat enough vitamin-B12-rich foods. </p>

                <p>Vitamin B12 is mainly found in animal products, especially meat and dairy products. Luckily for those on vegans diets, fortified foods can be good sources of this vitamin too.</p>

                <p>Here are some food sources of vitamin B12:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Eggs</li>
                    <li>Calms</li>
                    <li>Sardines</li>
                    <li>Beef</li>
                    <li>Tuna</li>
                    <li>Trout</li>
                    <li>Salmon</li>
                    <li>Animal liver and kidneys</li>
                    <li>Milk and Dairy products</li>
                    <li>Fortified nondairy milk</li>

                    <li>Fortified nutritional yeast</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is always better to maintain a balanced diet and receive healthful amounts of nutrients before active treatment is required. The symptoms of deficiency are easily avoided with a healthful diet.
