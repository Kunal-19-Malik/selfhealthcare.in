        <h1>Sulfur</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Sulfur is associated with protein foods with amino acids, such as dairy products, eggs, fish, meat, poultry and seafood. Sulfur helps these amino acids maintain their shapes so that they can perform their roles in the human body. 
        </p>
        <p>It’s all around you, including in the soil your food grows in, making it an integral part of many foods.</p>

           <p> Your body uses sulfur for various important functions, including building and repairing DNA, as well as protecting your cells against damage. Thus, including enough sulfur-rich foods in your diet is vital for your health. </p>
        <p>
            Sulfur helps to make cells rigid, such as those that are found in the hair, nails and skin. Nor are there risks of sulfur deficiency, unless there is extreme protein deprivation, or toxicity, unless protein supplements with sulfur are consumed in excess. Sulfur has a very characteristic rotten-egg smell that can be detected in some protein supplements. 
        </p>
        <p>Sulfur plays an important role in crucial functions in your body, such as making protein, regulating gene expression, building and repairing DNA, and helping your body metabolize food.  
        </p>
        <p>
           
        <p> This element is also essential for making and recycling glutathione — one of the body’s main antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and prevent cell damage caused by oxidative stress. </p>

        <p> Sulfur also helps maintain the integrity of connective tissues, such as your skin, tendons, and ligaments. </p>

        <p> Many foods and beverages — even drinking water from certain origins — naturally contain sulfur. Some medications and supplements, including certain antibiotics, analgesics, and joint pain remedies, contain varying levels of this mineral as well. </p> 
        
      </div>

      <div class="content-image">

      </div>

      <div class="headings" id="benefits">
        <h1>Health Benefits</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Your body needs sulfur to build and fix your DNA and protect your cells from damage that can lead to serious diseases such as cancers. Sulfur also assists your body to metabolize food and contributes to the health of your skin, tendons, and ligaments.   
        </p>

        <p>The two amino acids that include sulfur are methionine and cysteine. Methionine is an essential amino acid that cannot be synthesized by your body and must be consumed from protein-based sources. Cysteine, on the other hand, is a non-essential amino acid and is synthesized by your body. You don't need to consume it directly, but you do need to consume sulfur in forms that can be used to produce this compound. </p> 

           <p> Sulfur is also found in glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and methylsulfonylmethane, (which you may recognize as MSM). These three supplements are frequently used to relieve joint pain and inflammation. Some natural health practitioners believe they may also improve the quality of skin, fingernails, and other tissues.</p>
            
           <p> These therapeutic benefits are not completely proven or understood, however, it has been proposed that this may be due, in part, to the presence of serum sulfates in them. </p>


            
        <p>Some of the benefits are:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Gut inflammation</li>
        <li>Dandruff</li>
        <li>Osteoarthritis</li>
        <li>Allergies</li>
            
        </ul>

           <em> Consuming an adequate amount of sulfur may have the following benefits.</em></p>

      <div class="headings" id="deficiency">
        <h1>Deficiency</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>While following a diet containing enough sulfur is vital for your health, too much of this mineral may cause a few unpleasant side effects.
        </p>

        <p> Drinking water with high levels of sulfur may cause diarrhea. People with CD and UC may benefit from limiting the amount of certain sulfur-rich foods in their diet, but more research is needed.</p>

        
        <p> The early signs of deficiency include:</p>

        <ul>
        <li> Diarrhea </li>
        <li> Inflammatory bowel disease </li>
        <li> Ulcerative </li>

      <div class="headings" id="toxicity-dosage">
        <h1>Toxicity and Dosage</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>There is no recommended daily allowance for sulfur. Most people consume enough sulfur in their diet to meet the body's needs. </p>

        <p> There is no standard dose of sulfur supplements. Not enough is known about oral supplements to make such a recommendation, though various topical doses have been used in research.</p>

        
        <p> For example, in studies examining sulfur's effects on dandruff, shampoos containing 2% sulfur and 2% salicylic acid were used twice weekly for five weeks.</p>

            <p> When research studied sulfur treatments for scabies, treatments containing between 2% and 20% sulfur were applied every night for three to six nights.</p>

          
        <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

        <hr>
        <p>Sulfur is naturally found in a variety of foods and beverages. Sulfur-derived sulfite is another form of sulfur commonly added to some packaged foods.</p>
        
        <p>Dietary sulfur comes in many forms. It was once thought that animal-based proteins were the primary source of sulfur, but we now know that it’s also found in a variety of plant-based foods and non-protein foods. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for methionine has been set at 14 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, or approximately 1000 milligrams per day. No RDA has been set for other forms of sulfur.</p>

        <p>Good sources of sulfur include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Turkey, beef, eggs, fish, and chicken </li>
            <li> Nuts, seeds, grains, and legumes </li>
            <li> Chickpeas, couscous, eggs, lentils, oats, turkey and walnuts
            </li>
            <li> Allium Vegetables </li>
            <li> Cruciferous Vegetables </li>
            <li> Whole grains</li>
            <li> Leafy green vegetables </li>

        <p> Sulfur is a mineral involved in many important processes in your body, including the making and repairing of DNA. Therefore, eating enough sulfur-rich foods is essential for your health.</p>

        <p>There is no recommended daily allowance for sulfur. Most people consume enough sulfur in their diet to meet the body's needs. </p>

        <p> That said, drinking water containing too much of the mineral might cause loose stools and diarrhea. What’s more, a diet rich in sulfur may potentially worsen symptoms in people with certain inflammatory bowel diseases.</p>

        <p> Remember that most sulfur-rich foods also contain a variety of other beneficial nutrients. Those who suspect sulfur-rich foods to contribute to bowel discomfort may want to speak to a dietitian to ensure that their diet continues to meet their daily nutrient needs.</p>

          <p><em> A healthy, well-balanced diet is a great way to provide your body with a safe amount of this essential nutrient.</em></p>
