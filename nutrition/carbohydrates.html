        <h1>Carbohydrates</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Carbohydrates are found in a wide array of both healthy and unhealthy foods—bread, beans, milk, popcorn, potatoes, cookies, spaghetti, soft drinks, corn, and cherry pie. They also come in a variety of forms. The most common and abundant forms are sugars, fibers, and starches.</p>
        <p> Foods high in carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet. Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose, which is converted to energy used to support bodily functions and physical activity. But carbohydrate quality is important; some types of carbohydrate-rich foods are better than others:</p>
	<ul>
        <li> The healthiest sources of carbohydrates—unprocessed or minimally processed whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans—promote good health by delivering vitamins, minerals, fiber, and a host of important phytonutrients.</li>
	<li> Unhealthier sources of carbohydrates include white bread, pastries, sodas, and other highly processed or refined foods.  These items contain easily digested carbohydrates that may contribute to weight gain, interfere with weight loss, and promote diabetes and heart disease.</li>
</ul>
    <p> Many people immediately think of bread, pasta, rice and potatoes when someone says carbohydrate, and they’re not wrong, but many other foods contain carbs too:</p>
<ul>
<li>	Bread, rice, pasta, oats, quinoa, couscous</li>
<li>	Starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn and pumpkin)</li>
<li>	Beans and pulses (chickpeas, baked beans, lentils)</li>
<li>	Some dairy foods such as milk and yoghurt</li>
<li>	Fruit</li>
<li>	Sugar and honey</li>
</ul>
<p> Carbohydrates are our bodies’ preferred source of energy, so this macronutrient should make up a lot of our diet.</p>

        <h1>Types of Carbohydrates</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Did you know there are three main types of carbohydrate in food?</p> 
        <p> There are:</p>
<ul>
<li>	Starches (also known as complex carbohydrates)</li>
<li>	Sugars</li>
<li>	Fiber</li>
</ul>
    <p> You'll also hear terms like naturally occurring sugar, added sugar, low-calorie sweeteners, sugar alcohols, reduced-calorie sweeteners, processed grains, enriched grains, complex carbohydrate, sweets, refined grains and whole grains.</p>
    <p> No wonder knowing what kind and how much carbohydrate to eat can be confusing!</p>
    <p> On the nutrition label, the term "total carbohydrate" includes all three types of carbohydrates. This is the number you should pay attention to if you are carbohydrate counting.</p>
    <p> Carbohydrates are not all created equally. Some are considered simple carbohydrates and others are complex.</p>

    <ul>
<li><strong>	Simple carbohydrates</strong> are easy for your body to breakdown for energy or glucose. They have 1-2 sugar molecules and are found in items that are usually sweet such as honey, table sugar, syrup, agave nectar, molasses, milk/yogurt, and fruit. Fruit does contain a natural sugar called fructose, however, fruit also has vitamins and minerals (these are your micronutrients: nutrients needed in small amounts), phytochemicals (not a needed nutrient, but can have positive effects on health), and fiber. Fiber is not digested and therefore, increases the amount of time needed to break down the food item. </li>
<li><strong>	Complex carbohydrates</strong> take more time for your body to breakdown. They are long strands of sugar molecules strung together and typically have a savory taste. They are found in foods such as starches and grains: rice, pasta, bread, and starchy vegetables (potatoes, peas, corn). Other plant based foods such as non-starchy vegetables (beans, nuts, and seeds) contain carbohydrates, but in lower amounts. Complex carbs normally contain fiber unless they have been processed, where the grain has been stripped of its bran (outer coating), which gives us white bread, white pasta, white rice, etc. These types of carbs become easier for your body to digest. Even though they are not sweet they will release glucose quickly just like a sweet simple carbohydrate. </li>
</ul>

    <h3> What are “Net Carbs?”</h3>
    <p> Net carbs” are determined by subtracting any fiber or sugar alcohols on the label from the total carbohydrates. This is assuming that fiber and sugar alcohols are not absorbed or metabolized, but this is not always true, and some are partially digested and therefore still provide calories as well as impact blood sugar. The equation used to calculate net carbs is not entirely accurate because the contribution of fiber and sugar alcohols to total carbohydrates depends on the types present. The type of fiber or sugar alcohols used is not indicated on the nutrition facts label, therefore the effect on blood glucose and possible insulin therapy adjustments cannot be determined precisely.</p>
    <p> For this reason, we recommend using the total grams of carbohydrate and closely monitoring your blood sugar when consuming foods high in fiber or sugar alcohol to determine how they affect your body. </p>

    <h3> Why do we need carbs?</h3>
    <p> Carbs are the main energy source for our body. Complex carbohydrates, the healthy kind, should make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. If we eat the right amount and the right kind of carbs then it can help with weight management. They keep you feeling full and give you the energy your body needs to function at its best.</p>

<h3> What about no-carb diets?</h3>
    <p> By sticking to a no-carb diet you deprive yourself of the nutrients and an efficient fuel source. Plus, diets that require you to eliminate a certain type of food can be difficult to sustain in the long run.</p>
    <p> Often when you cut carbs from your diet, you end up eating more protein. Protein is necessary to build healthy muscles but the best way to fuel our body is with a balance diet.  One that includes plant based foods and lean proteins.</p>

    <p> Get the most out of your carbohydrates.</p>
    <p> Follow these tips to make sure you’re getting the most out of your carbohydrates:</p>
    <ul>
<li>	Limit added sugars and processed foods</li>
<li>	Incorporate a variety of whole plant based foods This includes, beans, peas and lentils, raw or steamed fruits and vegetables and whole grains.</li>
<li>	Choose low-fat dairy products. </li>
</ul>

      <div class="headings" id="Sugar">
        <h1>Sugar</h1>
        <hr>
        
    <p> Sugar is another type of carbohydrate. You may also hear sugar referred to as simple or fast-acting carbohydrate.</p>
    <p> There are two main types of sugar:</p>
    <ul>
<li>	Naturally occurring sugars such as those in milk or fruit</li>
<li>	Added sugars such as those added during processing such as fruit canned in heavy syrup or sugar added to make a cookie</li>
</ul>
    <p> On the nutrition facts label, the number of sugar grams includes both added and natural sugars.</p>
    <p> There are many different names for sugar. Examples of common names are table sugar, brown sugar, molasses, honey, beet sugar, cane sugar, confectioner's sugar, powdered sugar, raw sugar, turbinado, maple syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, agave nectar and sugar cane syrup.</p>
    <p> You may also see table sugar listed by its chemical name, sucrose. Fruit sugar is also known as fructose and the sugar in milk is called lactose. You can recognize other sugars on labels because their chemical names also end in "-ose." For example glucose (also called dextrose), fructose (also called levulose), lactose and maltose.</p>


<h3> Finding the amount of sugar</h3>
<p> Did you know that you can find the amount of both added and naturally occurring sugars listed in the new nutrition facts label? Learn how to decode the label.</p>
<h3> Sugar Alcohols</h3>
<p> Another item you may find on some foods’ nutrition facts label under total carbohydrates are sugar alcohols. Sugar alcohols are sweeteners that have about half the calories of regular sugar. Despite their name, they are neither a sugar nor and alcohol. They occur naturally in certain fruits and vegetables, but some are man-made and are added to processed foods. Many foods labeled "sugar free" or "no sugar added" have sugar alcohols in them.</p>
<h3> Sugar Substitutes</h3>
<p> There are so many products on the market now that are referred to as sugar substitutes. Most of these are nonnutritive sweeteners, which means that one serving of the product contains little or no calories or impact on blood glucose. Because these sweeteners are sweeter than sugar, they can be used in smaller amounts. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed several sugar substitutes and has approved or recognized them as safe for the public, including people with diabetes. </p>
<p> These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>	Saccharin (Sweet’n low)</li>
<li>	Neotame (Newtame)</li>
<li>	AcesulfameK (Sunett, Sweet One)</li>
<li>	Aspartame (Nutrasweet, Equal, Sugar Twin)</li>
<li>	Sucralose (Splenda)</li>
<li>	Advantame</li>
<li>	Stevia</li>
<li>	Luo han guo (monk fruit)</li>
</ul>
    <p> Most of these products are not broken down by the body; this means they pass through our system without providing calories. For some people, using these products are great alternatives to sugar. The potential decrease in calories and carbs could lead to better long-term blood sugar, weight and/or cardiometabolic health (think: heart and metabolism).</p>

    <p> A word of caution—claims like "sugar-free," "reduced sugar" or "no sugar added" are not necessarily carbohydrate-free or lower in carbohydrate than the original version of the food. We recommend that you read the Nutrition Facts label to understand how many carbs and calories you are eating.</p>

    <p> It’s also important to know that at this time, there is no clear evidence to suggest that using sugar substitutes will help with managing blood sugar or weight or improving cardiometabolic health in the long run. So here’s the bottom line:</p>
<ul>

<li>	Sugar substitutes are effective alternatives to sugar for some people, but not a perfect fit for all—it’s a personal choice.</li>
<li>	If you’re looking to reduce your intake of sugar or sugar substitutes, start slowly. For example, start by replacing one soda or juice with water or a no-calorie drink at a time.</li>
    <p> Water will always be a great choice! If you start feeling yourself get bored with just water, you can always spruce it up with fruits or herbs.</p>
</ul>

      <div class="headings" id="Starch">
        <h1>Starch</h1>
        <hr>
           <p> Foods high in starch include:</p>
            <ul>
        <li> Starchy vegetables like peas, corn, lima beans and potatoes</li>
        <li> Dried beans, lentils and peas such as pinto beans, kidney beans, black eyed peas and split peas</li>
        <li> Grains like oats, barley and rice. (The majority of grain products in the US are made from wheat flour. These include pasta, bread and crackers but the variety is expanding to include other grains as well.)</li>
            </ul>
           <p> The grain group can be broken down even further into whole grain or refined grain.</p>
           <p> A grain contains three parts:</p>
           <ul>
        <li> Bran</li>
         <li>Germ</li>
        <li> Endosperm</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The bran is the outer hard shell of the grain. It is the part of the grain that provides the most fiber and most of the B vitamins and minerals.</p>

        <p> The germ is the next layer and is packed with nutrients including essential fatty acids and vitamin E.</p>

        <p> The endosperm is the soft part in the center of the grain. It contains the starch. Whole grain means that the entire grain kernel is in the food.</p>

        <p> If you eat a whole grain food, it contains the bran, germ, and endosperm so you get all of the nutrients that whole grains have to offer. If you eat a refined grain food, it contains only the endosperm or the starchy part so you miss out on a lot of vitamins and minerals. Because whole grains contain the entire grain, they are much more nutritious than refined grains.</p>

        <p> Whole grains are just that: the whole plant that has been harvested and dried with little processing. They provide fiber as well as essential vitamins including B and E and other minerals needed for optimal health. Examples include oats, barley, bulgur, quinoa, brown rice, farro and amaranth. At least half of your daily grain intake should come from whole grains.</p>

        <p> Wondering what the deal is with “refined grains”? Basically, these grains are processed to remove the outer layers and most nutritious parts of the grain, meaning that we’re missing out on all the beneficial fiber, vitamins and minerals that the whole grain would typically provide. To avoid diseases caused by vitamin and mineral deficiencies, there are laws in place to make sure that essential vitamins and minerals be added back in during processing—this is what “enriched” means when you see it on the label.</p>

      <div class="headings" id="Fiber">
        <h1>Fiber</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Fiber comes from plant foods so there is no fiber in animal products such as milk, eggs, meat, poultry, and fish.</p>

    <p> Fiber is the indigestible part of plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes. When you consume dietary fiber, most of it passes through the intestines and is not digested.</p>

    <p> For good health, adults need to try to eat 25 to 30 grams of fiber each day. Most Americans do not consume nearly enough fiber in their diet, so while it is wise to aim for this goal, any increase in fiber in your diet can be beneficial. Most of us only get about half of what is recommended.</p>

    <p> Fiber contributes to digestive health, helps to keep you regular, and helps to make you feel full and satisfied after eating.</p>


    <p> Additional health benefits, of a diet high in fiber—such as a reduction in cholesterol levels—have been suggested by some so may be an additional benefit.</p>

    <p> Good sources of fiber include:</p>
    <ul>
<li>	Beans and legumes. Think black beans, kidney beans, pintos, chickpeas (garbanzos), white beans, and lentils.</li>
<li>	Fruits and vegetables, especially those with edible skin (for example, apples, corn and beans) and those with edible seeds (for example, berries).</li>
<li>	Whole wheat pasta</li>
<li>	Whole grain cereals (Look for those with three grams of dietary fiber or more per serving, including those made from whole wheat, wheat bran, and oats.)</li>
<li>	Whole grain breads (To be a good source of fiber, one slice of bread should have at least three grams of fiber. Another good indication: look for breads where the first ingredient is a whole grain. For example, whole wheat or oats.) Many grain products now have "double fiber" with extra fiber added.</li>
<li>	Nuts — try different kinds. Peanuts, walnuts and almonds are a good source of fiber and healthy fat, but watch portion sizes, because they also contain a lot of calories in a small amount.</li>
</ul>

    <p> In general, an excellent source of fiber contains five grams or more per serving, while a good source of fiber contains 2.5–4.9 grams per serving.</p>
    
    <p> It is best to get your fiber from food rather than taking a supplement. In addition to the fiber, these foods have a wealth of nutrition, containing many important vitamins and minerals. In fact, they may contain nutrients that haven't even been discovered yet!</p>

    <p> It is also important that you increase your fiber intake gradually, to prevent stomach irritation, and that you increase your intake of water and other liquids, to prevent constipation.</p>

    <h1>Dietary Fiber</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> Dietary fiber, also known as roughage, is the indigestible part of plant foods. Fiber has a host of health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes.</p>

    <p> Fiber is mostly in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes. There are two types of fiber — soluble and insoluble — and both play important roles in health:</p>

    <ul>

<li>	Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water and adds bulk to the stool, preventing constipation.</li>
<li>	Soluble fiber absorbs water, forming a gel-like substance in the digestive system. Soluble fiber may help lower cholesterol levels and help regulate blood sugar levels.</li>

</ul>

    <h3> Types of dietary fiber</h3>

    <p> Fiber includes nonstarch polysaccharides, such as cellulose, dextrins, inulin, lignin, chitins, pectins, beta-glucans, waxes, and oligosaccharides.</p>

    <p> Soluble and insoluble are the two types of dietary fiber.</p>

    <p> Most high fiber containing foods have both insoluble and soluble fiber, so people do not need to think much about the difference. Instead, they can focus on overall fiber intake.</p>

    <h4> Soluble fiber</h4>

    <p> Soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance in the stomach. Bacteria later break the gel down in the large intestine. Soluble fiber provides some calories to the individual.</p>

    <p> Soluble fiber absorbs water and becomes a sticky gel inside our digestive tract that helps soften the stool, making it easier to pass. It also binds to cholesterol and sugar, mitigating their release into the bloodstream.</p>

    <p> Soluble fiber acts as a prebiotic, promoting good gut bacteria, reducing inflammation, and boosting immunity.</p>

    <p> Soluble fiber provides the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
<li>	Lowering LDL cholesterol in the blood by affecting how the body absorbs dietary fat and cholesterol</li>
<li>	Slowing absorption of other carbohydrates through digestion, which can help regulate blood sugar levels</li>
</ul>
   <p> Good sources of soluble fiber include:</p>
   <ul>
<li>	Fruits</li>
<li>	Oats</li>
<li>	Nuts</li>
<li>	Vegetables</li>
<li>	Avocados</li>
<li>	Barley</li>
<li>	Dry beans and peas</li>
<li>	Most fruits</li>
<li>	Nuts and seeds</li>
</ul>


   <h4> Insoluble fiber</h4>

    <p> Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water and passes through the gastrointestinal tract, mostly intact. It does not provide calories.</p>

    <p> Insoluble fiber helps build bulk in the stool, helping a person pass stool more quickly. It can also help prevent constipation.</p>

    <p> Insoluble fiber isn’t broken down during digestion or absorbed into the bloodstream. It adds bulk to stool for easier elimination, reducing the incidence of constipation and protecting against colon cancer.</p>

    <p> Good sources of insoluble fiber include:</p>
<li>	Fruits</li>
<li>	Nuts</li>
<li>	Vegetables</li>
<li>	Whole grain foods</li>
<li>	Barley</li>
<li>	Brown rice</li>
<li>	Bulgur or whole-grain cereals</li>
<li>	Couscous</li>
<li>	Seeds</li>

        <p>Carbohydrates are essential for good nutrition and sustained energy. Choosing unprocessed carbohydrates more often than refined ones will help your body gain the maximum benefits that this macronutrient has to offer. While there are no "good" or "bad" foods, it's wise to consider refined carbs once-in-a-while treats as opposed to a significant portion of your dietary pattern.</p>
        

          <p><em> A healthy, well-balanced diet is a great way to provide your body with a safe amount of this essential nutrient.</em></p>
