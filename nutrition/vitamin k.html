        <h1>Vitamin K (Phytonadione)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Vitamin K refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins that play a role in blood clotting, bone metabolism, and regulating blood calcium levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deficiency is rare, but, in severe cases, it can increase clotting time, leading to hemorrhage and excessive bleeding.
        </p>
        <p> Vitamin K1, or phylloquinone, comes from plants. It is the main type Source of dietary vitamin K. A lesser source is vitamin K2, or menaquinone, which occurs in some animal-based and fermented foods.</p>
        <p>
            Vitamin K is actually a group of compounds. The most important of these compounds appears to be vitamin K1 and vitamin K2. Vitamin K1 is obtained from leafy greens and some other vegetables. Vitamin K2 is a group of compounds largely obtained from meats, cheeses, and eggs, and synthesized by bacteria.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vitamin K plays a key role in helping the blood clot, preventing excessive bleeding. Unlike many other vitamins, vitamin K is not typically used as a dietary supplement.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Vitamin K helps to make various proteins that are needed for blood clotting and the building of bones. Prothrombin is a vitamin K-dependent protein directly involved with blood clotting. Osteocalcin is another protein that requires vitamin K to produce healthy bone tissue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vitamin K is found throughout the body including the liver, brain, heart, pancreas, and bone. It is broken down very quickly and excreted in urine or stool. Because of this, it rarely reaches toxic levels in the body even with high intakes, as may sometimes occur with other fat-soluble vitamins.
        </p>
        <p>Newborns have very little vitamin K. They usually get a shot of vitamin K soon after they are born.</p>

      <div class="headings" id="benefits">
        <h1> Benefits</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Several studies have suggested that vitamin K supports the maintenance of strong bones, improves bone density and decreases the risk of fractures.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are different types of vitamin K. Most people get vitamin K from plants such as green vegetables, and dark berries. Bacteria in your intestines also produce small amounts of another type of vitamin K.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This vitamin has many functions, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong> Cognitive Health:</strong> Increased blood levels of vitamin K have been linked with improved episodic memory in older adults.In one study, healthy individuals over the age of 70 years with the highest blood levels of vitamin K1 had the highest verbal episodic memory performance.</li>
            <li><strong> Heart Health:</strong> Vitamin K may help keep blood pressure lower by preventing mineralization, where minerals build up in the arteries. This enables the heart to pump blood freely through the body.Mineralization naturally occurs with age, and it is a major risk factor for heart disease. Adequate intake of vitamin K has also been shown to lower the risk of stroke.
            </li>
            <li><strong> Bone Health:</strong>Vitamin K is involved with the production of proteins in bone, including osteocalcin, which is needed to prevent the weakening of bones. Some studies have shown that higher vitamin K intakes are associated with a lower incidence of hip fractures and low bone density. In addition, low blood levels of vitamin K have been linked with low bone density. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Blood Clots:</strong>Vitamin K helps to make four of the 13 proteins needed for blood clotting, which stops wounds from continuously bleeding so they can heal. People who are prescribed anticoagulants (also called blood thinners) to prevent blood clots from forming in the heart, lung, or legs are often informed about vitamin K. Because of its blood clotting action, vitamin K has the potential to counteract the effects of blood thinning medications. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some other benefits of Vitamin K are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>May help prevent osteoporosis and support strong bones</li>
            <li>May improve episodic memory in older adults</li>
            <li>May help keep blood pressure down</li>
            <li>May lower your risk of cardiovascular disease</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
           <em> Consuming an adequate amount of vitamin K may have the following benefits.</em></p>

      <div class="headings" id="deficiency">
        <h1>Deficiency</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Vitamin K deficiency in adults is rare, but may occur in people taking medications that block vitamin K metabolism such as antibiotics, or in those with conditions that cause malabsorption of food and nutrients. 
        </p>
        <p>A deficiency is also possible in newborn infants because vitamin K does not cross the placenta, and breast milk contains a low amount. The limited amount of blood clotting proteins at birth increases the risk of bleeding in infants if they are not given vitamin K supplements.  </p>
        <p>The following are common signs of a deficiency: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A longer time for blood to clot or a prolonged prothrombin time (as measured in a physician’s office)</li>
            <li>Bleeding</li>
            <li>Hemorrhaging</li>
            <li>Osteopenia or osteoporosis</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Low levels of vitamin K can raise the risk of uncontrolled bleeding. While vitamin K deficiencies are rare in adults, they are very common in newborn infants. A single injection of vitamin K for newborns is standard. Vitamin K is also used to counteract an overdose of the blood thinner Coumadin.</p>

      <div class="headings" id="toxicity-dosage">
        <h1>Toxicity and Dosage</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>No tolerable upper limit has been determined for vitamin K. Toxicity is rare and unlikely to result from eating foods containing vitamin K. </p>
        <p>However, taking any type of supplement can lead to toxicity.</p>
        <p>The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin K varies depending on age, gender, weight and several other factors.  However, the suggested RDA is typically 70 to 90 micrograms (mcg) for adults.</p>
        <p>Adults need approximately 0.001 milligrams (mg) — or 1 mcg — of vitamin K for every kilogram (2.20 lbs.) of body weight. So, a person who weighs 150 lbs. (68 kg) should get 68 mcg of vitamin K a day.</p>
        <p>Vitamin K can interact with several common medications, including blood-thinners, anticonvulsants, antibiotics, cholesterol-lowering drugs, and weight-loss drugs. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong> Blood thinners:</strong> such as warfarin are used to prevent harmful blood clots that may block blood flow to the brain or heart. They work by decreasing or delaying vitamin K’s clotting ability. Suddenly increasing or decreasing vitamin K intake can interfere with the effects of these drugs. Keeping vitamin K intake consistent from day to day can prevent these problems.</li>
            <li><strong> Anticonvulsants:</strong> if taken during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, can increase the risk of vitamin K deficiency in a fetus or a newborn. Examples of anticonvulsants are phenytoin and dilantin.</li>
            <li><strong> Cholesterol-lowering:</strong> interfere with fat absorption. Dietary fat is necessary for absorbing vitamin K, so people who are taking this medication may have a higher risk of deficiency.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you take blood thinners, you need to be careful about how much vitamin K you get. You also need to be careful about taking vitamin E supplements. Vitamin E can interfere with how vitamin K works in your body. </p>
        <p>Anyone who is taking any of these medications should speak to their doctor about their vitamin K intake.  </p>    
        <p>The best way to ensure the body has sufficient nutrients is to consume a balanced diet, with plenty of fruit and vegetables. Supplements should only be used in case of deficiency, and then, under medical supervision.  </p>   
        <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

        <hr>
        <p>Vitamin K1 occurs in high amounts in leafy green vegetables, such as kale and Swiss chard. Other sources include vegetable oils and some fruits. </p>
        <p>Sources of menanoquines, or K2, include meat, dairy products, eggs, and Japanese “natto,” made from fermented soy beans.</p>
