        <h1>Calories</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A calorie is a unit of energy. In nutrition, calories refer to the energy people get from the food and drink they consume, and the energy they use in physical activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Calories are listed in the nutritional information on all food packaging. Many weight loss programs center around reducing the intake of calories.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most people only associate calories with food and drink, but anything that contains energy has calories. 1 kilogram (kg) of coal, for example, contains 7,000,000 calories.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two types of calorie:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong> A small calorie (cal)</strong> is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram (g) of water by 1º Celsius (º C).</li>
            <li><strong> A large calorie (kcal)</strong> is the amount of energy required to raise 1 kilogram (kg) of water by 1º C. It is also known as a kilocalorie.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            1 kcal is equal to 1,000 cal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The terms “large calorie” and “small calorie” are often used interchangeably. This is misleading. The calorie content described on food labels refers to kilocalories. A 250-calorie chocolate bar actually contains 250,000 calories.
        </p>
        <p>
            A calorie is a unit that measures energy. Calories are usually used to measure the energy content of foods and beverages. To lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than your body burns each day.
        </p>
        <p>The human body needs calories to survive. Without energy, the cells in the body would die, the heart and lungs would stop, and the organs would not be able to carry out the basic processes needed for living. People absorb this energy from food and drink.
        </p>
        <p>If people consumed only the number of calories needed every day, they would probably have healthy lives. Calorie consumption that is too low or too high will eventually lead to health problems.</p>
        <p>The number of calories in food tells us how much potential energy they contain. It is not only calories that are important, but also the substance from which the calories are taken.</p>

        <p>The calorific values of three main components of food:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> 1g of carbohydrates contains 4 kcal</li>
            <li> 1g of protein contains 4 kcal</li>
            <li> 1g of fat contains 9 kcal</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Calories are essential for human health. The key is consuming the right amount.</p>
        <p>Foods high in energy but low in nutritional value provide empty calories.
        </p>

        <h1>Daily Requirements</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The average man needs 2,700 kcal per day and the average woman needs 2,200 kcal per day.
        </p>
        <p>Not everybody needs the same number of calories each day. People have different metabolisms that burn energy at different rates, and some people have more active lifestyles than others.</p>
        <p>
            The recommended intake of calories per day depends on several factors, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Overall general health</li>
            <li>Physical activity demands</li>
            <li>Sex</li>
            <li>Weight</li>
            <li>Height</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Women</h3>
        <p>The average, moderately active woman between the ages of 26–50 needs to eat about 2,000 calories per day to maintain her weight and 1,500 calories per day to lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) of weight per week.</p>

        <p>Young women in their early 20s have higher calorie needs. They require about 2,200 calories per day to maintain their weight.</p>

        <p>Women over age 50 generally require fewer calories. The average moderately active woman over 50 needs about 1,800 calories per day to maintain her weight and 1,300 calories per day to lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week.</p>

        <h3>Men</h3>

        <p>The average, moderately active man between the ages of 26–45 needs 2,600 calories per day to maintain his weight and 2,100 calories per day to lose 1 (0.45 kg) pound per week.</p>

        <p>Young men ages 19–25 have higher energy needs. They require an average of 2,800 calories per day to maintain their weight and up to 3,000 if they’re active. To lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week, moderately active young men should consume 2,300–2,500 calories daily.</p>

        <p>Energy needs decrease as men age. Between the ages of 46–65, moderately active men need an average of 2,400 calories per day. After 66 years, the average man’s calorie needs decrease to about 2,200 calories per day.</p>

        <h3>Children</h3>

        <p>Children have widely varying calorie needs based on their age, size, and activity level.</p>

        <p>Whereas the average toddler requires 1,200–1,400 calories per day, the average moderately active teenager requires 2,000–2,800 calories per day. Active teenage boys require even more.</p>
        
        <p>Children who are growing and developing normally and engage in regular physical activity usually don’t need to count calories. When they’re provided with a range of healthy options to eat, most moderately active kids naturally eat the amount of food their body requires.</p>

        <h1>Empty Calories</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Empty calories are those that provide energy but very little nutritional value. The parts of food that provide empty calories contain virtually no dietary fiber, amino acids, antioxidants, dietary minerals, or vitamins.
        </p>
        <p>Empty calories come mainly from solid fats and added sugars.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong> Solid fats:</strong> Although these exist naturally in many foods, they are often added during industrial food processing, as well as during the preparation of certain foods. Butter is an example of a solid fat.</li>
            <li><strong> Added sugars:</strong> These are sweeteners that are added to foods and beverages during industrial processing. They are filled with calories. In the U.S., the most common types of added sugars are sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Added sugars and solid fats are said to make foods and drinks more enjoyable. However, they also add many calories and are major contributors to obesity.</p>
        <h2>Sources of empty calories</h2>
        <p>The following foods and drinks provide the largest amounts of empty calories:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Solid fats and Added sugar</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Ice Cream</li>
        <li>Donuts</li>
        <li>Pastries</li>
        <li>Cookies</li>
        <li>Cakes</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Solid Fats</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Ribs</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Hot Dogs</li>
        <li>Sausages</li>

        <h1>Burning Calories</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>For the human body to remain alive, it needs energy.</p>
        <p>Around 20 percent of the energy we take in is used for brain metabolism. Most of the rest is used in basal metabolism, the energy we need when in a resting state, for functions such as blood circulation, digestion, and breathing. </p>
        <p>In a cold environment, we need more energy to maintain a constant body temperature, as our metabolism increases to produce more heat. In a warm environment, we need less energy. </p>
        <p>We also need mechanical energy for our skeletal muscles, to maintain posture and move around.</p>
        <p>Cellular respiration is the metabolic process by which cells get energy by reacting oxygen with glucose to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy.</p>
        <p>How efficiently energy from respiration converts into physical—or mechanical— power depends on the type of food eaten, the type of physical energy, and whether muscles are used aerobically or anaerobically.</p>    
        <p>In other words, we need calories to fuel bodily functions, such as breathing and thinking, to maintain our posture, and to move around.</p>

        <h1>Reduce Calorie Intake</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Calories are simply a measure of energy. To gain weight, you need to consume more calories than you expend. Conversely, you lose weight if you use more calories than you consume.</p>
            <p>That said, cutting calories without considering which foods you eat is usually not a sustainable way to lose weight. For example, choosing more nutrient-dense foods will benefit your health more than opting for nutrient-poor ones.</p>
            <p>Though it works for some people, most end up hungry and eventually revert to their old habits.</p>
            <p>For this reason, it’s highly recommended to make a few other permanent changes to help you maintain a calorie deficit in the long term, without feeling starved.</p>
            <p>The following evidence-based eating and lifestyle changes have been shown to help people lose weight.</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Eat More Protein</li>
                <li>Avoid sugary soft drinks and fruit juices</li>
                <li>Drink more water</li>
                <li>Exercise and lift weights</li>
                <li>Reduce your refined carb intake</li>

          <ol>
              <li><strong> Eat breakfast:</strong> A protein and healthy fat breakfast can keep you full for longer and help prevent snacking during the day.</li>

            </li>
            <li><strong> A little of what you fancy:</strong> Banning foods can lead to cravings and bingeing. Spoil yourself occasionally with a favorite treat, but in smaller amounts.</li>
            <li><strong> Get enough sleep:</strong> Sleep loss affects the metabolism, and it has been linked to weight gain.</li>
            <li><strong> Avoid eating 2 hours before bed:</strong> Eating within 2 hours of sleeping can interfere with sleep quality and promote weight gain.</li>

          <p>Calories seem to be linked only to weight gain and obesity, but they are vital for health. They only pose a health risk when people consume more than the recommended amount.</p>
          <p>When thinking about calories, you should not be considering just your diet but also your level of physical activity. A high intake of calories can be countered with regular, high-intensity exercise.</p>
          <p>Reducing calories does not mean starving yourself. A few simple dietary and lifestyle changes, including exercising, properly hydrating, and increasing your protein intake, can help you lose weight and feel satisfied.</p>
          <p><em> A healthy, well-balanced diet is a great way to provide your body with a safe amount essential nutrients.</em></p>
