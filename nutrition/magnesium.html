        <h1>Magnesium</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Magnesium is an important mineral, playing a role in over 300 enzyme reactions in the human body. Its many functions include helping with muscle and nerve function, regulating blood pressure, and supporting the immune system. 
        </p>
        <p>
             Several studies have shown that hypomagnesemia is a common electrolyte derangement in clinical setting especially in patients admitted to intensive care unit where it has been found to be associated with increase mortality and hospital stay. Hypomagnesemia can be caused by a wide range of inherited and acquired diseases. 
        </p>
        <p>It can also be a side effect of several medications. Many studies have reported that reduced levels of magnesium are associated with a wide range of chronic diseases. Magnesium can play important therapeutic and preventive role in several conditions such as diabetes, osteoporosis, bronchial asthma, preeclampsia, migraine, and cardiovascular diseases. 
        </p>
        <p>
           
        <p> Many people get enough magnesium in their diet, though deficiency symptoms are uncommon in otherwise healthy people.</p>

        <p> Doctors link magnesium deficiency with a range of health complications, so people should aim to meet their daily recommended levels of magnesium.</p>

        <p> Almonds, spinach, and cashew nuts are some of the foods highest in magnesium. If a person cannot get enough magnesium through their diet, their doctor may recommend taking supplements.</p> 
        
      </div>

      <div class="headings" id="benefits">
        <h1>Health Benefits</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Magnesium is one of seven essential macrominerals. These macrominerals are minerals that people need to consume in relatively large amounts — at least 100 milligrams (mg) per day. Microminerals, such as iron and zinc, are just as important, though people need them in smaller amounts.   
        </p>

        <p>Magnesium is vital for many bodily functions. Getting enough of this mineral can help prevent or treat chronic diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and migraine. </p>

        <p>A number of enzymes, hormones, and cell-signaling molecules depend on phosphorylation for their activation. Phosphorus also helps maintain normal acid-base balance (pH) by acting as one of the body's most important buffers.</p>

            
        <p>Some of the benefits are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Diabetes</li>
            <li> Bone Health</li>
            <li> Cardiovascular Health</li>
            <li>Migraine Headaches</li>
            <li>Premenstrual Syndrome</li>
            <li>Anxiety</li>
            
        </ul>

           <em> Consuming an adequate amount of phosphorus may have the following benefits.</em></p>

      <div class="headings" id="deficiency">
        <h1>Deficiency</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>A deficiency due to low dietary intake is not common in healthy people. However, ongoing low intakes or excessive losses of magnesium due to certain health conditions, chronic alcoholism, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, or intestinal surgery, and/or the use of certain medications, can lead to magnesium deficiency.
        </p>

        <p> While many people do not meet their recommended intake for magnesium, deficiency symptoms are rare in otherwise healthy people. Magnesium deficiency is known as hypomagnesemia.</p>

        <p> Magnesium inadequacy or deficiency can result from excess consumption of alcohol, a side effect of certain medications, and some health conditions, including gastrointestinal disorder and diabetes. Deficiency is more common in older adults.</p>
        
        <p> The early signs of magnesium deficiency include:</p>

        <ul>
        <li> Loss of appetite </li>
        <li> Nausea </li>
        <li> Vomiting </li>
        <li> Fatigue </li>
        <li> Weakness </li>
        </ul>

        <p> As magnesium deficiency gets worse, other symptoms may occur, including:</p>

        <ul>

        <li> Numbness </li>
        <li> Tingling </li>
        <li> Muscle contractions and cramps </li>
        <li> Seizures </li>
        <li> Personality changes </li>
        <li> Abnormal heart rhythms </li>
        <li> Coronary spasms </li>

      </div>

      <div class="headings" id="toxicity-dosage">
        <h1>Toxicity and Dosage</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Toxicity is rare from food sources because the kidneys will remove excess magnesium in the urine. However toxic levels may occur with long-term use of high-dosage supplements. People with kidney disease have a higher risk of toxicity because their kidneys are not working properly and cannot flush out extra magnesium.</p>

        <p>  An adult body contains around 25 gram (g) of magnesium, 50–60% of which the skeletal system stores. The rest is present in muscle, soft tissues, and bodily fluids.</p>

        
        <p> An overdose of magnesium through dietary sources is unlikely because the body will eliminate any excess magnesium from food through urine.</p>


        <p> However, a high intake of magnesium from supplements can lead to gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea, nausea, or cramping.</p>


        <p> Very large doses can cause kidney problems, low blood pressure, urine retention, nausea and vomiting, depression, lethargy, a loss of central nervous system (CNS) control, cardiac arrest, and possibly death.</p>


            
            <p>Signs of toxicity include:</p>        
        <ul>
           <li> Nausea, vomiting</li>
           <li> Diarrhea</li>
           <li> Low mood, depression</li>
           <li> Muscle weakness</li>
           <li> Low blood pressure, abnormal heartbeat</li>
           <li> Heart attack </li>

           </ul>
       

        <p> People with a kidney disorder should not take magnesium supplements unless their doctor advises that they do so.</p>

          
        <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

        <h1>Sources</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Many foods contain high levels of magnesium, including nuts and seeds, dark green vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Manufacturers also add magnesium to some breakfast cereals and other fortified foods.</p>
        

        <p>Good sources of magnesium include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Almonds </li>
            <li> Spinach </li>
            <li> Roasted cashews </li>
            <li> Oil roasted peanuts </li>
            <li> Soy milk </li>
            <li> Cooked black beans</li>
            <li> Cooked edamame beans </li>
            <li> Peanut butter </li>
            <li> Whole wheat bread </li>
            <li> Avocado </li>
            <li> Potato with skin </li>
            <li> Cooked brown rice </li>
            <li> Low fat yogurt </li>
            <li> Fortified breakfast cereals</li>
            <li> Oatmeal</li>
            <li> Canned kidney beans </li>
            <li> Banana </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Wheat products lose magnesium when the wheat is refined, so it is best to choose cereals and bread products made with whole grains. Most common fruits, meat, and fish contain low in magnesium.</p>
        
        <p><em> A diet rich in magnesium is an essential step toward good health and disease prevention. </em></p>
