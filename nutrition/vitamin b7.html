                <h1>Vitamin B7 (Biotin)</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Vitamin B7, also known as Biotin is one of the water-soluble and highly essential B-complex vitamins. Termed as Vitamin H where the letter ‘H’ represents’ Haar und Haut’, which are German words for "hair and skin", it is pivotal for a wide range of metabolic processes in the body including enzyme synthesis for several crucial metabolic pathways’ metabolism of fats and carbohydrates, as well as synthesis of amino acids which are necessary for protein synthesis.</p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B7 cannot be synthesized by human cells, but it is produced by bacteria in the body, and it is present in numerous foods.</p>
                <p>
                    Biotin therapy may help treat some medical conditions. Some people take supplements to strengthen their nails and hair, but there is a lack of evidence supporting this use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Primarily, Biotin is a type of co-enzyme that is required for the synthesis of fatty acids which are molecules found in fats and oils; glucogenesis, i.e. synthesis of glucose from amino acids and fatty acids; and synthesis of leucine, a quintessential amino acid that the human body cannot generate on its own. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Biotin is synthesized by only bacteria, molds, yeasts, algae, and certain plants. The human body cannot synthesise biotin on its own and has to depend on outer dietary sources to replenish the required amount. It is extremely essential in maintaining good hair, skin, and nails. It improves neural functioning and helps in the metabolism of nutrients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Biotin is known to promote cell growth and is often a component of dietary supplements used for strengthening hair and nails, as well as those marketed for skin care. 
                </p>
                <p>While biotin deficiency is extremely rare, it may cause dermatitis, brittle fingernails, diabetes, hair loss (alopecia), and perosis. Biotin is necessary for healthy skin, nails, and hair.
                </p>

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Although Biotin cannot be absorbed by hair or skin, it contributes towards healthy nails, skin and hair, and hence plays a key role and feature in many cosmetic and health products used for enhancing the skin and hair quality. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Biotin is extremely essential for hair, skin and nails. It improves the texture of the skin by preventing oxidative damage. It also rejuvenates and moisturises the skin, reduces various signs of ageing like wrinkles, fine lines, spots, dark circles etc, making it crystal clear. In case of the hair, biotin is pivotal for strengthening the hair from the root to the tips. It retains the natural colour of the hair and prevents breakage and hair fall.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    It locks the moisture in the hair strands and prevents the hair from turning brittle. Daily intake of food and supplements containing biotin is also beneficial for nails. It is also extremely beneficial in improving nail quality and preventing brittle nails.  
                </p>
                <p>Several kinds of scientific researches conclude that biotin holds high significance in controlling the release of insulin from the beta-pancreatic cells, thereby reducing blood sugar levels in the body and keeping diabetes under control and therefore helpful for people suffering from Type 1 or Type 2 forms of diabetes or diabetic neuropathy. </p>
                <p>Vitamin B7 is also essential in improving the cognitive functioning of the brain. It helps in repairing the brain cells and in turn, is used for treating symptoms associated with psychotic conditions like brain fog, depression, schizophrenia, hallucinations, etc. it also treats biotin responsive basal ganglia disease and hence promotes healthy functioning of the nervous system.</p>
                <p>Biotin is helpful in the case of people suffering from kidney problems. It also effectively reduces muscle cramps and pain during dialysis. It is also beneficial for improving vision and treating conditions like seborrheic dermatitis, cradle cap in children and auto-immune diseases like multiple sclerosis in adults. It is also extremely crucial in promoting the health of the baby in pregnant women and even after birth.</p>
                
                

                <p>This vitamin has many functions, including:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>Maintaining a healthy pregnancy</li>
                 <li>Nails, hair, and skin</li>
                 <li>Lowering blood glucose</li>
                 <li>Controling neuropathy</li>
                 <li>Biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease</li>
                 <li>Treating multiple sclerosis</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Biotin supplements are often glamorized as a treatment for hair loss and to promote healthy hair, skin, and nails. Although a deficiency of biotin can certainly lead to hair loss and skin or nail problems, evidence showing a benefit of supplementation is inconclusive. </p>
                <p>
                    Some evidence has shown that those suffering from diabetes may be susceptible to biotin deficiency. Since biotin is an important factor in the synthesis of glucose, it may help maintain an appropriate blood sugar level in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes.

                <h1>Deficiency</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Biotin deficiency is rare in humans, because biotin is widely available in foods, and the “good” gut bacteria can normally synthesize more biotin than the body needs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Biotin deficiency mostly occurs due to a lack of this quintessential ingredient from the daily diet. Regular consumption of egg white for several months can lead to biotin deficiency due to the avidin content in eggs. Avidin is a type of protein found in eggs, which binds tightly with the biotin in the intestines and prevents them to get absorbed by the body or function properly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some of the signs of biotin deficiency are characterized by loss of hair, dry brittle nails, scaly, red rash around the eyes, nose, and mouth, dry eyes, scaly dry skin causing dermatitis, conjunctivitis, sore tongue, nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other symptoms are related to psychological or neurological problems, which include depression, types of insomnia, hallucinations, lethargy, numbness and tingling sensation in the arms and legs.
                </p>

                
                


                <p>Alcoholism can increase the risk of biotin deficiency and many other nutrients as alcohol can block their absorption, and also because alcohol abuse is generally associated with a poor dietary intake. About a third of pregnant women show a mild biotin deficiency despite eating adequate intakes, though the exact reason is not clear.</p>
                <p>Symptoms appearing with a biotin deficiency:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Thinning hair</li>
                  <li>Scaly skin rashes around eyes, nose, mouth</li>
                  <li>Brittle nails</li>
                  <li>Lethargy</li>
                  <li>Hallucinations</li>
                  <li>numbness and tingling in the hands and feet</li>
                  <li>Increased risk of bacterial and fungal infection
                </li>

                    People who are suffering from hereditary biotin deficiency have a weakened immune system, increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections. Pregnant women are at higher risk of suffering from biotin deficiency, hence should have a well-balanced diet to evade the deficiency syndromes.

                  <h3>Biotinidase Deficiency</h3>  
                <p>Biotinidase deficiency is another cause of biotin deficiency. This is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder.
                </p>

                <p>In people with this condition, the body does not produce enough of the enzyme needed to release biotin from proteins in the diet during digestion or from normal protein turnover in the cell.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>
                    No evidence in humans has shown a toxicity of biotin even with high intakes. Because it is water-soluble, any excess amount will leave through the urine. There is no established upper limit or toxic level for biotin.    
                </p>

                <p>Several studies suggest that adults should take 30 mcg of biotin per day.</p>
                
                <p>
                    Anything more than that can cause skin allergies characterized by rashes, flushing and itchiness. which when reaches the chest can also lead to anaphylaxis.   
                </p>

                <p>Other symptoms of overdosage due to biotin include excessive thirst, urination, insomnia and alarmingly low level of vitamin B6 and vitamin C. Since it is useful for the metabolism of glucose, people suffering from diabetes should consult a doctor before taking any biotin supplements as overdosage can be harmful.</p>


                <p>If biotin is taken with alpha-lipoic acid, the body may not be able to absorb either of them effectively. The same is true of vitamin B5, or pantothenic acid.</p>
                                
                <p><em>It is always best to check with a doctor before taking a supplement, especially for people with an existing health condition and those who are taking other drugs.</em></p>

                    Like any other water-soluble vitamins, this vitamin biotin is not prepared within the body and gets washed away, hence one should consume a diet rich in vitamin B7 food options to prevent the deficiency syndromes. Hence to fulfil the dietary needs one has to strictly depend on external food sources and supplements.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B7 is found in a number of foods, though in small amounts. This includes walnuts, peanuts, cereals, milk, and egg yolks. Other foods that contain this vitamin are whole meal bread, salmon, pork, sardines, mushroom and cauliflower. Fruits that contain biotin include avocados, bananas and raspberries. In general, a healthy varied diet provides the body with sufficient amounts of biotin.  
                </p>
                
                <p>Most foods have some vitamin B7. People with a well-balanced diet do not tend to develop a deficiency. Medical conditions and certain medications can lead to a deficiency.</p>

                <p>Here are some food sources of vitamin B7:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Egg Yolks</li>
                    <li>Legumes</li>
                    <li>Nuts and Seeds</li>
                    <li>Liver</li>
                    <li>Sweet Potatoes</li>
                    <li>Mushrooms</li>
                    <li>Bananas</li>
                    <li>Broccoli</li>
                    <li>Yeast</li>
                    <li>Avocados</li>
                    <li>Pork</li>
                    <li>Fish (Salmon)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Consuming adequate amounts of vitamin B7 is important for optimal health. </p>
                <p>
                    Vitamin B7 is very stable and does not gets destroyed easily, hence the food sources can be cooked and consumed.
